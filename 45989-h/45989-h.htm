<p class='c002'><a href='#chI'><span class='sc'>Chapter I—Old Friends Get Together</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Overlanders plan for their summer’s vacation in
the saddle. Emma Dean “dotes on mysteries.”
Hippy Wingate gets a hard blow. Stacy amazes
his new friends by his dramatic entrance. Shots
and yells startle the Overland Riders.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chII'><span class='sc'>Chapter II—An Interrupted Sleep</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The traveling salesman entertains his fellow passengers
with tales of wrecks and hold-ups. Chunky
makes the passengers laugh. Emma Dean has an
attack of “nerves.” Sheriff Ford is suspicious. The
“Red Limited” comes to a jolting stop. “Robbers!”
screams a woman.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chIII'><span class='sc'>Chapter III—The Hold-up of the Red Limited</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>An ominous silence settles over the transcontinental
express. The sheriff calls for volunteers to drive
off the train bandits. Overland girls offer their
services. The treasure car cut off. Stacy, in his
pajamas, joins the defenders.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chIV'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV—In a Lively Skirmish</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>“Dynamite!” exclaims Sheriff Ford. Defenders
give battle. Stacy Brown shoots and talks. Hippy
goes on a desperate mission. Bandit guards are
outwitted. Lieutenant Wingate caught in a tight
place. “I know you!” yells the Overland Rider.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chV'><span class='sc'>Chapter V—On the Trail of the Missing</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Sheriff Ford starts a search for Lieutenant Wingate.
A clue at last. “Captured by the bandits!” exclaims
Tom Gray. Chunky helps himself to a plum pudding.
“Suffering cats! You’re it!”</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chVI'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI—Chunky Meets the Bandits</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The fat boy stampedes the outlaws’ horses. “Oh,
wow! I’ve lost my biscuit.” A pony that knew the
way. “I suppose I emptied twelve saddles,” boasts
Stacy. Shots arouse the sheriff’s camp. “Lie low,
everybody!”</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chVII'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII—Bandits Catch a Tartar</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Lieutenant Wingate, unconscious, is carried away
on a pony’s back. A cruel blow. A pin-prick saves
the day. The escape of the Overland captive. “Cease
firing! It’s Hippy!” The traveling salesman in
a new rôle.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chVIII'><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII—Headed for the High Country</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Woo Smith joins the Overland outfit. Stacy declares
that his pony can climb a tree. “I want food!”
is the fat boy’s plaint. The Overlanders are introduced
to a “kyack.” Packs are “thrown” and the
journey to the Sierras is begun.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chIX'><span class='sc'>Chapter IX—Their Slumbers Disturbed</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>“All aboard for the High Sierras!” The Chinaman
proves to be a rare find. “You leave it to Smith,”
advises Hippy. Stories of rattlesnakes in campers’
blankets set the Overland girls’ nerves on edge.
Woo savvies “transmigration.”</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chX'><span class='sc'>Chapter X—“Boots and Saddles”</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The Overland camp in an uproar. “Snakes! Oh,
wow!” howls the fat boy. “Me savvy somebody
pull queue,” wails Woo Smith. The dark mystery
is finally solved. Stacy Brown proves to be an unwilling
“wrangler.”</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXI'><span class='sc'>Chapter XI—Ponies Get a Bad Fright</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Hippy uses a pea-shooter with disastrous results.
The fat boy awakens in a wild rose bush. Suspicion
becomes a certainty. Overlanders make a perilous
descent. “The ponies are stampeding!” shouts
Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXII'><span class='sc'>Chapter XII—Amid the Giant Sequoias</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>“Look! Oh, look,” cries Emma Dean. Lieutenant
Wingate shoots a cinnamon bear. “Uncle Hippy never
misses what he hits.” Stopped by a rattler. Tom
Gray lost in the great forest. Watched over by
trees centuries old.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXIII'><span class='sc'>Chapter XIII—The Camp at the “Lazy J”</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>A surprise in the High Sierras. Overland Riders entertained
at a mountain ranch. Stacy tries to shoe
a horse. The white mare gets into action. Warned
against the High Country. “Keep away from the
‘Crazy Lake’ section,” advises the foreman.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXIV'><span class='sc'>Chapter XIV—Woo’s Eyes Are Keen</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The Chinaman sights a “buck in lelet.” Hippy
misses a “sure shot.” “Why don’t you use a pea-shooter?”
jeers Stacy. A rifle that had been tampered
with. “I—I just wanted to get even with you.”
A shot that reached the mark.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXV'><span class='sc'>Chapter XV—Following the Aerial Trail</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The Overland Riders enjoy a venison dinner. Elfreda
Briggs is reminded of Coney Island. Crossing a perilous
mountain ridge. Emma Dean is afraid and
doesn’t care who knows it. The white mare meets
with sudden disaster.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXVI'><span class='sc'>Chapter XVI—Going to Bed in the Clouds</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Kitty gives her masters a perilous job. Stacy offers
to get a derrick. A scene to be remembered. Getting
up in the world. Tom Gray makes up the Overlanders’
beds with a pick. Stacy objects to being
buried so soon after supper.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXVII'><span class='sc'>Chapter XVII—In the Land of Pink Snows</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Woo loses a “piecee kettle” over the brink. The
campfire disappears in the clouds. Camping in the
valley of the blue lupines. A trail that was difficult to
find. Elfreda becomes suddenly light-headed.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXVIII'><span class='sc'>Chapter XVIII—At the “Top of the World”</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The mystery of the “pink snows” is finally solved by
Tom. A snowball battle above the clouds. On the
peak of the High Sierras. The Overland Riders go to
sleep in a snowbank. “Girls, this is an ideal summer
resort.”</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXIX'><span class='sc'>Chapter XIX—Bowling in Nature’s Alley</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Hippy Wingate gives his companions a delightful
surprise. The Overlanders withdraw their threat to
throw him off the mountain. A mysterious lake is
discovered. Emma Dean scores a hit. Bullets stop
the highest bowling game on record.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXX'><span class='sc'>Chapter XX—Lead and Mystery in the Air</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Overland Riders suddenly find themselves under
fire. Stacy “creeps” to safety. “Get up and walk,
you tenderfoot!” The Aerial Lake lives up to its
reputation. Woo Smith savvies trouble. “Discovered!”
exclaims Hippy.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXXI'><span class='sc'>Chapter XXI—The Face in the Waters</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The guide informs the Overlanders that a woman has
been spying on the camp. Stacy feels like a snowbird.
Prowlers leave a trail. Lieutenant Wingate
meets with an unpleasant surprise. The pool of the
mountain trout and what Grace Harlowe saw there.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXXII'><span class='sc'>Chapter XXII—The Mystery of Aerial Lake</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Grace Harlowe flees from a hideous face. The Overland
girls are eager to solve the mountain mystery.
Stacy Brown discovers an “ark” and goes out for a
sail. The fat boy mysteriously missing. Woo consults
the skies. The lost boy returns with an appetite.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXXIII'><span class='sc'>Chapter XXIII—The Lair of the Bad Men</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>Chunky laughs at his companions’ distress. Lieutenant
Wingate invites his nephew out for a “paddle.”
Stacy makes an important discovery. Plunder found
in the bandits’ cave. The log that was chained down.
Bullets drive the Overlanders from their quest.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#chXXIV'><span class='sc'>Chapter XXIV—Making a Last Stand</span></a></p>

<p class='c003'>The Overland Riders are fired on by the mountain
ruffians. Imprisoned by dynamite in the robbers’
cave. A battle that came to a sudden end. Sheriff
Ford to the rescue. Mother Jones’ career is ended.</p>

  <h1 class='c004'>GRACE HARLOWE’S OVERLAND RIDERS IN THE HIGH SIERRAS</h1>
</div>

<div>
  <h2 id='chI' class='c005'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />OLD FRIENDS GET TOGETHER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Who is this Stacy Brown that you
girls are speaking of?” questioned
Emma Dean as the Overland girls
sat down to dinner in Grace Harlowe’s hospitable
Haven Home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is my Hippy’s nephew,” Nora Wingate
informed her. “You will like ‘Chunky,’ as he is
known to his friends, and I promise you that he
will keep this outfit from getting lonely,” added
Nora laughingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was one of the members of the Pony
Rider Boys’ outfit,” volunteered Grace. “You
know we have heard of them several times on our
journeyings. They used to go out in search of
adventure every summer, so Stacy is a seasoned
campaigner. We shall need him where we are
going, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the way, where are we going, Grace?”
spoke up Elfreda Briggs. “I believe our destination
is to be in the nature of a surprise—a
mystery, as it were.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I just dote on mysteries,” bubbled Emma.
“Of course I could have learned all about it had
I not been too conscientious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is characteristic of your sex,” replied
Hippy Wingate soberly. “May I ask you how
you could have found out?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thank you for the compliment, and regret
exceedingly that I cannot return the compliment
in kind. How could I have found out? Why, by
the transmigration of thought.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The what?” cried Elfreda laughingly. “Is
this some new freak, Emma Dean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It may be new with me, but the principle
is as old as the ages. I belong to the Society for
the Promotion of Thought Transmigration. Our
great and Most Worthy Master lives in Benares,
India, where numbers of the faithful journey for
instruction and inspiration once every two years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean to say that you belong to that
fool outfit?” wondered Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am happy to say that I do. I joined last
winter, and, novice that I am, I have realized
some remarkable results,” replied Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nora, we ought to take her to a specialist
before we start on our journey. It won’t do to
have a crazy person with us. She might get us
into no end of trouble,” suggested Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph! I’d much prefer to be crazy than
to have a bungalow head,” retorted Emma scornfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A bungalow head?” exclaimed the girls.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. A bungalow has no upper story, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ouch!” cried Hippy Wingate, clapping both
hands to his head. “Now that our Sage of India
has spoken, suppose Grace and Tom enlighten
us as to where we are going this summer. In view
of the fact that this is my treat—that I have
offered to pay the expenses of the Overland Riders
on this journey—it might not be inappropriate
for me to inquire where we are going. Elfreda’s
question in that direction is as yet unanswered.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Gray nodded to his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had intended to wait until Stacy Brown
arrived, but as he is not a member of our little
organization, there is no reason why our business
matters should be discussed with him,” said Grace.
“Dear friends, we are going to the High Sierras,
the great snow-clad peaks of the far west. Adventure,
hardship and health are awaiting us
there. It will be a long journey before we reach
the beginning of our real objective, but I believe
you folks will agree with me that the preliminary
journey is well worth while.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You say that Hippy is paying the bills?”
interjected Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has so said. However, Tom will not have
it that way, so we have agreed that Tom and
Hippy shall share equally in the expense of the
journey. Both feel quite rich now since they
cleaned up on their big lumber deal in the North
Woods,” replied Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elfreda said that such an arrangement would
not please her at all, declaring that she would
pay her own expenses.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have nothing to say about it,” laughed
Tom. “The subject is closed. So far as our
having Stacy Brown as our guest, is concerned,
you all agreed to that when Grace wrote to you
about his wish to join us on our summer outing.
Are you still of the same mind?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” answered the girls in chorus.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What about a guide? Is that arranged for?”
asked Miss Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not yet,” answered Grace. “We thought we
would leave that until we reached our destination.
Oh, girls, I have some of the loveliest trips
in mind for several seasons ahead, but I’m not
going to tell you a word about them now. In the
meantime, anyone that has a suggestion to offer
will please offer it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have no suggestions to offer, but I should
like to ask further light on this new dope that
Emma Dean has sprung on us. What is it, and
how does it work?” asked Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you won’t make fun of me I’ll tell you,”
replied Emma. “The transmigration of thought
is ‘tuning-in’ one’s mind to receive messages
from the mind of another person, just as a wireless
operator ‘tunes-in’ his instrument to catch
the message being sent by another operator far
away. In other words, persons so attuned to each
other may converse, read each other’s thoughts
and hold communion, even though separated by
thousands of miles of sea or land or both.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Marvelous!” breathed Hippy. “For instance,
please tune-in your mind and tell me what
I am thinking about. Let’s see you do that, if
you can,” he declared triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our minds never could be in perfect accord,
Theophilus Wingate. We are as far apart as the
poles, but our range being so short, I can easily
tell you what you are thinking about. Not being
a deep thinker, you are as transparent as a piece
of clear crystal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Emma, don’t you say that about my Hippy,”
protested Nora indignantly. “My Hippy has a
mind as big as his heart, and—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are thinking,” interjected Emma gravely,
“what a shallow little butterfly I am, but what
you do not know is that that thought is merely
the reflection of your own mentality. You are,
in other words, seeing yourself as others see you,
Hippy Wingate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A peal of laughter from the Overland girls
greeted Emma’s retort. Hippy flushed, then
joined in the laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is so sudden,” he murmured. “I’ll tell
you what you do. Wait until Stacy arrives, then
you just practice your transmigration stuff on
him. Stacy will make a wonderful subject for
you. He is so temperamental, so spiritual, that I
am positive you and he will get wonderful results.”
Hippy winked at Nora as he said it.</p>

<p class='c007'>None of the others had ever seen Stacy Brown,
so they had not the least idea what was in store
for them from the comedian of the Pony Rider
Boys’ outfit. Stacy was an old campaigner, however,
and Hippy knew that he would prove a
valuable member of their party on the ride into
the High Sierras. Stacy knew the open, and with
his companions had experienced many exciting
adventures in the wilder parts of the country. The
Overland Riders, too, had had their full share of
thrilling adventure, first as members of the Overton
College Unit in France during the great war,
where Hippy Wingate had won honors as a fighting
air pilot, and Tom Gray at the front as a
captain of engineers. However, they had a new
phase of excitement to experience in “Chunky”
Brown, and the first of those experiences was near
at hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>A shot suddenly broke the summer stillness of
Haven Home, a shot that brought the Overland
Riders to their feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Bang, bang, bang!</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merciful Heaven! Are we attacked?” cried
Elfreda Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whoop! Yeo-o-o-o-o-w!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Three more shots were fired, followed by a succession
of startling whoops and yells.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What does it mean? I’m afraid!” cried
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders ran out of the dining room to
the veranda, but no one was in sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Chunky has arrived. Don’t be afraid, girls,”
laughed Hippy Wingate. “He is on the other
side of the house. There he comes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>A short, fat young fellow, riding a gray bronco
and perched high on his saddle, at this juncture
dashed around the end of the house, firing two
shots into the air as he passed the amazed group.
Just as he swept past, his sombrero fell off, but
Chunky did not stop. In a minute or two he was
back, and, making a graceful dip from the saddle,
reached down for the hat. As he did so, the pony
swerved and Stacy Brown landed on the grass of
Haven Home, flopped over on his back, and
after a few dazed seconds got up and shook
himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy made a low bow to the spectators
gathered on the veranda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my dear, my dear! Are you hurt?”
begged Nora, running to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hurt? Of course not. I always fall off before
dinner. It puts a keen edge on my appetite.
Hulloa, folks! Glad to meet ye. Hey, Bismarck!
Come here,” he ordered.</p>

<p class='c007'>His dusty gray pony trotted to him and nosed
Stacy’s cheek affectionately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Got anything loose around the house? I’m
half starved,” urged Chunky. “Uncle Hip, introduce
me to these beautiful young ladies. I’ve
heard of you folks, and so has Bismarck. You’ll
find him right friendly, especially the front end
of him, but I shouldn’t advise you to get too
close to the tail end. He is very light there. Let
him browse in the yard while I feed the inner
man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed not,” objected Grace. “I am not
going to have my flowers trampled down after all
my hard work on them this spring. Tom, please
lead Stacy’s pony around to the stables. I will
put something on the table for you at once, Stacy.
Come right in. We were just finishing dinner
when you arrived so violently. Oh! Pardon me.
You haven’t yet been introduced to the girls.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks!” bowed Stacy. “Thanks for the invitation,
but come to think of it don’t introduce
me until after dinner. I never like to meet
strangers on an empty stomach.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is Miss Elfreda Briggs, a rising young
lawyeress, and here is the life of our Overland
party, Miss Emma Dean. We address each other
by our first names, so you may call her Emma.
Come now, Stacy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re a funny fellow, aren’t you?” said
Emma, surveying the newcomer curiously as they
walked towards the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then we are a pair of ’em, eh?” chuckled the
fat boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not a boy, thank my lucky stars and all
the saints,” objected Emma. “I’ll have you
understand that, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let the dove of peace rest over your touchy
spirit, Emma,” laughed Grace chidingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It isn’t a dove. It’s a crow,” corrected
Chunky. “A thousand pardons, Emma dear.
I—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not your dear,” answered Emma with
considerable heat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you are, but you don’t know it. To
realize it you will have to emerge from the unconscious
state in which you now so sweetly repose,”
teased Stacy, amid the laughter of the
others.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should prefer to be unconscious all the
time,” flung back Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! The food does smell good. Food always
has a strange effect on me, and really, I haven’t
smelled any in almost a thousand years—not
since breakfast this morning. By the way, where
do we go and when do we start?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the Sierras,” answered Tom Gray. “How
are you, Chunky?” he added, extending a hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Starved. How’s yourself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think after we go back to the dining room
and after I have my dessert that I shall feel fit
as a fiddle,” replied Tom. “To answer the rest
of your question, we expect to start tomorrow
forenoon. The ponies will be shipped in a car
that is now on the siding at Oakdale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Girls, what do you think of my nephew?”
cried Hippy jovially, as they again seated themselves
at the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So far as I am concerned, I think that he is
another of those bungalow fellows just like yourself,
Hippy,” answered Emma. “Mr. Brown, may
I ask if you ever have had any experience with
mental transmigration?” she asked, turning to
Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chunky, his mouth full of food, surveyed her
solemnly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uh-huh!” he replied thickly. “I met one
of those animals once in the Rocky Mountains.
You see it was this way. We had been riding far
into the night to find a suitable camping place,
when we were suddenly halted by a savage growl
just ahead of us. I went on ahead, with my
trusty rifle ready, to slay the beast whatever it
might be. Suddenly I saw him. He was the most
terrible looking object that I’ve ever come up
with in all my mountain experience. I threw up
my rifle and shot the beast dead in his tracks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wonderful!” breathed Emma. “But what
has that to do with mental transmigration?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m coming to that. It is wonderful—I mean
it was. Will you believe it, that terrible beast
came to life. Yes, sir, he rose right up and made
for us. My pony bolted, and I fell off—just as
I ordinarily do before meal time. My feet at the
moment chanced to be out of the stirrups and I
fell off. Well, I might have been killed—I surely
would have been killed, but I wasn’t, just because
of that stunt that you mentioned. I transmigrated
myself out of that vicinity with a speed
that left that terrible object so far behind that
he just lay down and died again,” finished Stacy
Brown solemnly, amid shouts of laughter, in
which all but Emma Dean joined.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy gave her a quick sidelong glance, and
Hippy Wingate, observing the look, knew that war
had been declared between Stacy Brown and
Emma Dean.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chII' class='c008'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />AN INTERRUPTED SLEEP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Right at this point,” said the traveling
salesman impressively, “a train left
the track and plunged into that ravine
down there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any loss of life?” questioned Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A great many. I was in that wreck myself.
I was shaken up a bit, that’s all. You see I know
how to take care of myself. We commercial
travelers have to or we should soon be out of
business. Nearly the whole train went into that
ravine, and the car in which I was riding stood on
end. I clung to the air-brake cord and thus was
miraculously saved.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph!” muttered Stacy, hunching his fat
shoulders forward. “You don’t look to be light
enough to perch on an air-brake cord.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overland girls glanced amusedly at
Chunky and the traveling salesman. The entire
party was enjoying the late afternoon mountain
air from the rear platform of the observation
car on the transcontinental train known as the
Red Limited. Just inside the door sat other passengers,
who had been enjoying the frequent
passages-at-arms between Stacy Brown and
Emma Dean. The train had been rumbling over
bridges and lurching through narrow cuts, affording
the passengers brief views of a swiftly moving
scenic panorama of interest and attractiveness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As I was saying, the rope, in all probability,
saved my life, as I was the only person in the
car that came out alive,” continued the traveling
salesman. “I’m in ladies’ fine shoes, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy and Emma regarded the speaker’s large
feet, glanced at each other and grinned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll bet you couldn’t transmigrate them,”
whispered the fat boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Emma elevated her nose, but made no reply
to the trivial remark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I mean that I am selling ladies’ fine shoes,
young man,” added the salesman, he having observed
the fat boy’s grin. “My card.” He passed
business cards to those nearest to him, and from
them the Overlanders learned that he was William
Sylvester Holmes, traveling for a Denver shoe
firm. “My trade call me ‘Bill,’” he explained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, Bill!” muttered Hippy, nudging Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“May I ask what car you were in?” questioned
a tall, bronzed passenger in a mild, apologetic
voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The same as this one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hm-m-m! That’s odd. I do not recall
having seen you. However, I was in the other end
of the car, which perhaps accounts for it,” said
the stranger in a more humble voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Sylvester flushed. Instead of being
overcome, however, he shifted his conversation to
another train wreck that he said had occurred
a few miles further on at a place called Summit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The faces of the Overland Riders expanded into
discreet smiles at the mild way in which the tall
man had rebuked the loquacious traveler. Grace
and Elfreda, in particular, found themselves much
interested in this big man. Grace asked a fellow
passenger who the man was, and learned that he
was Bill Ford, for some years sheriff of Sonora
County. Ford had been observing the traveling
salesman through mild blue eyes in which there
appeared an expression of more than casual
interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was that Summit wreck that nearly did me
up,” resumed Holmes. “We went over an embankment
there. Being in a berth in a sleeping
car I was unable to grab hold of anything. The
car played football with me, but I came off with
nothing more serious than a broken arm. Oh, I
have had my experiences! Were you in that
wreck, too?” he asked, turning quickly to the
sheriff.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never heard of it,” answered Ford carelessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All that saved us was the fact that the cars
were made of steel. We’ll pass Summit within
the hour, and I’ll show you where we went off
the rails that time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell us about something that happened when
the train didn’t leave the rails,” urged Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With pleasure. I remember, some two years
ago—it was this very train, I do believe—when
a party of bandits held up a train on this line.
That occurred between Summit and Gardner.
They uncoupled the express car and, after compelling
the engineer to haul it up the track a short
distance, dynamited the car and robbed it of the
treasure it was carrying.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’ve been cutting up that same kind of
caper quite lately,” nodded the sheriff.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Di—id they rob the passengers?” stammered
Emma Dean.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In some of the cars, yes. In my car they did
not. I held them off with my revolver. I——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was very careless of you. Why, sir,
you might have shot yourself,” cried Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Holmes gave the fat boy a withering glance
and resumed his story.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After my display of courage the other passengers
got brave, and with their assistance I
drove the bandits off. However, I should not
advise it. For the average person, the safe course
is to sit still and take his medicine. Gentlemen,
never offer resistance when a gang of bandits
orders you to put up your hands, but put them
up as fast as you can and let them stay put,”
he added, fixing his gaze on Tom Gray who smiled
and nodded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir,” agreed Chunky. “That’s the way
I always do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Were you ever held up?” questioned the
salesman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Many times. I put up my hands too, but
there was a gun in both of ’em,” answered Stacy
amid much laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this juncture a passenger asked the storyteller
to tell them more about the hold-up, which
he did without urging.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The train in question was carrying a treasure,
just as this one no doubt is. The bandits had
obtained information of this fact from a confederate.
They were right on the job when the
train came along. After stopping the train they
placed men at the car door to take up a collection
from the passengers. All submitted tamely, as
they should have done, except in the car where
I was, and—we are approaching Summit now.
From that point we go down grade for twenty
miles or so, then we begin to climb again. We
stop at Summit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Isn’t it terrible, all that banditry. I’m
afraid,” shivered Emma when a little later the
party had gone to the dining car for supper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For one who can transmigrate as well as you
can, there should be no fear,” suggested Hippy.
“Just transmigrate the bandits to some other
train.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think we should transmigrate ourselves in
the event of such a thing occurring,” vouchsafed
Elfreda Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sheriff Ford came into the dining car shortly
after the train had left Summit, and nodded at
the party in a friendly fashion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What has become of our story-telling friend,
sir?” asked Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I saw him go into the smoking car ahead as
the train was leaving Summit. He sent two telegrams
before leaving. This shoe business requires
a lot of telegraphing, it appears,” added the
sheriff dryly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you know it was about shoe business?”
demanded Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I happened to see the last telegram.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Gray eyed the sheriff inquiringly, but the
mild blue eyes of Mr. Ford conveyed nothing to
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a pleasant evening, during which they
saw no more of the traveling salesman, the
Overland party retired to their berths for sleep.
Forward, near the express car, rode the
Overlanders’ ponies in as much comfort as is possible
to provide for animals en route. At every stop
during the day one of the men of the party had
run forward to look over the car of “stock,” as
the riders called their saddle animals. Now, however,
all were too soundly asleep to think of
ponies, and above the rumble of the train might
be heard the rasping snores of Stacy Brown and
Hippy Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was shortly after one o’clock in the morning
when many of the sleepers were awakened by a
sudden disconcerting jolt caused by an abrupt
application of the air brakes. The train slowly
settled down to a slow crawl, the hiss of the air
from the brakes being plainly audible to those
who had been awakened.</p>

<p class='c007'>The train stopped. Nothing of an alarming
nature seemed to have occurred, so the nervous
passengers again settled down into their blankets,
for the night air was chill and penetrating.
Others lay awake, but there was nothing to hear
except the snores which continued without
interruption.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few moments of this and then a subdued
murmur of voices was heard just ahead of the
Overlanders’ car. A brief period of silence followed
the murmur, then a man’s voice, agitated
and full of alarm, was raised so high that almost
every person in the car was awake on the instant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?” cried a woman’s voice from behind
berth curtains.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’re held up! The train is held up!” cried
the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Robbers! Robbers!” screamed the woman
who had asked the question; and a chorus of
frightened voices took up the refrain.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIII' class='c008'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />THE HOLD-UP OF THE RED LIMITED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Take it easy! Don’t lose your heads.
We are safe for the moment,” urged
a voice that sounded like Sheriff
Ford’s. Whoever it was, his words brought a
measure of quiet to the excited passengers who
were shivering in the aisle in scant attire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The passengers then sought their berths again
and began dressing, for there would be no more
sleep for them that night. Outside of the car
there was not the slightest indication that anything
out of the ordinary was occurring. An
ominous stillness enshrouded the scene. Some
one, more curious than the rest, stepped to the
front platform of the sleeping car and, opening the
vestibule door, looked out. The Overlanders
learned later that it was Mr. Ford.</p>

<p class='c007'>A rifle shot roared out, whereupon the sheriff
prudently stepped back and closed the door.
Several smothered screams were heard, and then
silence once more settled over the car.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to the present time not a word had been
heard from the Overland Riders. The curtains
of their berths hung motionless, and Stacy
Brown’s snores were louder than ever. Perhaps
they were all asleep, but how that could be possible
in the circumstances it would be difficult to
understand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The voice of Sheriff Ford once more focused
the attention of the passengers on him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Men,” he said, addressing the passengers from
one end of the car, “this train is being held up,
but it does not look as if the passengers will be
disturbed. If they are not, it means that the
bandits are after the express car, in which, as I
happen to know, there is a large amount of gold
for shipment to the Pacific Coast for export. I
am an officer of the law. The fact that I am not
in my own county is sufficient excuse for my
sitting down and letting the bandits have their
own way, but I’m not that kind of a critter. I’m
going out to take a hand in this affair, and I ask
all the men in this car, who have weapons, to join
me. Provided we get help from the other cars of
the train, we can, perhaps, drive the robbers off.
How many of you men are with me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Two passengers stepped out from their berths.
The curtains of the berths occupied by Lieutenant
Theophilus Wingate and Captain Tom Gray were
thrust aside, the curtain hooks rattling on the rods
overhead, and they were revealed clad in shirts,
trousers and boots, each with a revolver strapped
on, sitting quietly on the edge of his berth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Isn’t there another <i>man</i> in this car?” questioned
Ford sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this juncture Grace Harlowe, Elfreda Briggs,
Nora Wingate and Emma Dean stepped out into
the aisle, each wearing a revolver at her side,
and Emma very pale and shaking in the chill air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are not men, but we are ready to do whatever
you wish, Mr. Ford,” announced Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ford smiled and nodded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought so,” he said. “This appears to be
about all we can depend upon. As for you young
women, my hat is off to you, but this is no job
for women. It’s a man’s job. What you can do,
however, is to mount guard over this car and
protect the other women. Can you all shoot?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace said they could.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well. Guard the vestibules, but in no
circumstances open the vestibule door. The
other passengers will please remain in their berths
to avoid the possibility of being shot, and you
young women will be careful that you do not
shoot the train crew. Challenge first, then shoot,
if you are not positive as to who any person is.
Have you men ammunition?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” answered Hippy. “Lead us to it. We
haven’t had any action in so long that we are
going stale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will go out by the rear door,” announced
the sheriff. “Please do not use your weapons
until you are ordered to do so. The most we can
hope to accomplish is to drive the bandits off—make
them think they are attacked by a posse.
There isn’t much chance of our being able to
capture the gang or any of them, much as I should
like to do so. Yet I’m going to try to get hold
of at least one. All ready!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be careful, Hippy darling,” begged Nora as
the little party moved towards the rear of the car.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You watch my smoke,” chuckled Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good luck,” smiled Grace, waving a kiss to
Tom as he turned to nod in return for her parting
words.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ford stepped out into the rear vestibule and
peered through the window into the darkness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll go first,” he said. “You follow when I
give the signal. Not a word from any of you.
Wait!” Lifting the trap-door in the vestibule
floor, the sheriff let himself down on the steps,
then cautiously stood up on the outside, revolver
in hand for use in case of trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come out!” he commanded in a low voice.
“There appears to be no one here. There goes the
express car!” he added as a slight jolt of the train
was heard. “They’ve cut out that car and are
going to pull it up the track a piece and force it
open. We’ll have to hurry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ford started on a run, the others falling in
behind him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to this time no one had given Stacy Brown
a thought, but as the party was leaving the sleeper
something awakened him. Then Stacy heard
someone say, “robbers!” The fat boy tumbled
out into the aisle in his pajamas.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wha—what is it?” he demanded sleepily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The train is held up,” answered Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! Wow!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and Tom, Hippy and Mr. Ford, with two
other passengers, have just gone out by the rear
door to see what they can do to help us out,”
announced Miss Briggs. “You are a fine brave
fellow to sleep through all this uproar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They have gone to capture the bandit outfit
and get their heads shot off for their pains,” jeered
the voice of a male passenger from the forward
end of the car.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re a brave man, aren’t you?” chided
Emma, directing her remark at Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fat boy blinked sleepily, then all of a
sudden he woke up to a fuller realization of the
situation. Emma’s remark had passed unnoticed,
but the taunt of the cowardly passenger had sent
the blood pounding to Stacy’s temples. The boy
snatched his revolver from his grip and buckled on
the holster, starting for the rear door at a run.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We can’t all be heroes,” he flung back at the
passenger who had jeered at the Overlanders.
“Some of us are born cowards with a stripe of
yellow a yard wide through us. Go to sleep,
children! I’ll bag the lot of ’em and fetch ’em
back for you to look at.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy fell through the opening in the platform,
the trap-door still being open. In the fall, he
bumped all the way from the platform to the
ground, where he fetched up heavily in a sitting
posture.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey, you fellows! Where are you? Wait for
me, I’m on the way,” he bellowed. “I’ve got the
medicine with me. Sing out where you are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fat boy started to run along the side of the
train. He could not see his companions, but he
was positive that they could not be far in advance
of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“W-a-i-t!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who’s that?” demanded Ford sharply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It sounds like Brown of our party,” laughed
Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For goodness sake, go back and stop his noise
or we’ll have the robbers down on us,” urged Ford.
“Run for it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy started back at a brisk trot, on the alert
for the presence of bandit sentries. He nearly
collided with Stacy, and, knowing that the fat boy
was impulsive, Hippy feared that Stacy might
take him for a train robber and shoot, so he
dropped down the instant he discovered his companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop that noise! Do you want to get hurt?”
demanded Hippy sternly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Course I don’t. I want to hurt a robber.
Where are they?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will find out soon enough if you don’t
keep quiet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what I’m making a noise about. I
want to call ’em out; then you’ll see what Stacy
Brown and his little gun can do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are not to use your revolver until Mr.
Ford gives you permission to do so. He is in command
of our party. The bandits are supposed to
be somewhere ahead of us. Come along, but don’t
you dare make a sound. Where have you been
all the time?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sleeping. Isn’t that what folks buy sleeping
car tickets for?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hurry,” urged Hippy, who ran on, followed by
Stacy, stumbling and grunting, making enough
noise to be heard several car-lengths away. The
two came up with the others of their party at the
front end of the forward car, where Ford had
halted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are they?” demanded Stacy. “I’m
ready to capture the whole bunch. All I want
now is to be shown. I’m a wild-cat for trouble
when I get stirred up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silence, young man! I’ll do all the talking
necessary. You will get your wish for action soon
enough, and I reckon you’ll get some of the brag
taken out of you, too,” retorted Ford sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not if I see ’em first,” gave back Stacy belligerently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the order, Mr. Ford?” questioned
Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will go off to one side. It won’t do to
follow the railroad tracks. To do so would surely
draw the fire of the bandits. There are several
on guard not far from us,” he added in a whisper,
having been observing closely as he talked. “I
think I now know the lay of the land. Be careful,
all of you. If you will look sharp you will
see that the bandits have the treasure car near
the mouth of the ravine that leads up into the
mountains.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’ve taken our stock car too,” groaned
Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s so. The ponies are gone, Ford,” whispered
Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon they count on making a get-away on
your horses,” answered the sheriff. “We’ll be
able to block that game, I hope. Come!”</p>

<p class='c007'>After having walked some distance parallel with
the tracks, the sheriff’s party slowed down at a
signal from their leader. Lanterns were seen
moving about beside the tracks a short distance
ahead of the sheriff. The safety valve of the
engine was blowing off steam, the blow-off growing
to a deafening roar that died down only when
the engine pulled away from the express, baggage
and stock cars. The locomotive came to a stop
a short distance from the three cars, then the
sound of a heavy object beating against the side
door of one of the cars, was heard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’re trying to smash in the door of the
express car,” whispered Ford.</p>

<p class='c007'>A volley of shots was fired at the car door by
the bandits and was promptly answered by shots
from within the car. The men in the express
car appeared to be vigorously resisting the attack.
They were firing at the band outside with such
good effect that the robbers soon ceased their
attempts to beat in the door with the section of
a telegraph pole that they were using for the
purpose. A period of silence followed while the
bandits were holding a hurried consultation; then
followed a movement among them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me shoot! They’re getting away, I tell
you,” urged Stacy excitedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not yet, young man. Those fellows are up to
more mischief, and I think I know what it
is,” answered Ford in a tense voice. “Men, we
must get in and get in at once or we shall be too
late. It is time to move. Listen to me, then
obey promptly.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIV' class='c008'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />IN A LIVELY SKIRMISH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“We will crawl across the tracks between
the engine and the cars,”
whispered the sheriff. “Once on
the other side we must get to the rear of the
bandits, and as soon as we find cover there we
shall begin to shoot. I hope we may be in time.
When we reach the other side of the rails I wish
you men to spread out, but I want to know where
every man of our party is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ford started at a run, the others following,
fully as eager as the sheriff to get into action.
They had barely reached the rails when there
occurred a sudden, blinding flash, followed by a
heavy report.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dynamite!” exclaimed Ford. “I expected
that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our poor ponies,” groaned Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If they get near my Bismarck he’ll kick the
everlasting daylights out of them,” growled Stacy
Brown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t we do something?” urged Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. We’re going to do something and do
it right quick,” answered Ford grimly. “Fellows,
remember that the bandits have rifles, while we
have only our revolvers. You look out for those
rifles, is my best advice to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They reached the other side of the railroad
tracks without loss of time and without attracting
attention to themselves, and it was soon
evident to the sheriff’s party that the dynamite
had not accomplished its purpose. The explosive
had not been well placed, and the express car had
been little damaged, though a hole had been dug
out beside the tracks from the force of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I give the word, shoot, but shoot
over their heads,” commanded Ford incisively.
“Spread out and get down on your stomachs when
you have taken your positions. Get going!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The men of the party crept along, skulking
through the bushes that grew on the mountain
side along the railroad right of way. One by
one the members of the party dropped down and
lay awaiting the word of command. Every now
and then a shot would be fired from the interior
of the express car, answered in each instance by a
volley from the bandits.</p>

<p class='c007'>The preparations of Sheriff Ford up to this
time had been made swiftly. The signal agreed
upon for beginning the attack on the train
bandits was two quick shots from Ford’s revolver.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thin line of assailants waited in tense
silence for the beginning of hostilities. The members
of the little party were steady, although
their pulses beat high, for no one deluded himself
into the belief that this affair was going to
be wholly one-sided.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two sharp reports from Ford’s revolver, even
though eagerly looked for, came so unexpectedly
that every member of the party was startled,
but their panic lasted for only a few seconds.
Six heavy revolvers answered the signal. Three
bullets sped harmlessly over the heads of the
men who were trying to rob the express car.
Three other bullets from the weapons of Ford,
Tom and Hippy, by arrangement at the last
moment before the party spread out, had been
fired low enough to reach the legs of the bandits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course there could be no fine shooting on
account of the darkness, but the sheriff and the
two men with him did very well indeed, if the
yells of rage that came from the bandits could
be depended upon as indication of hits.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Down!” warned Ford when the revolvers had
been emptied. Every man in the party well
knew what was coming.</p>

<p class='c007'>The expected was not long in arriving. A
volley of heavy rifle shots ripped over the heads of
the sleeping-car party. Ford’s party quickly reloaded
as they lay; then began firing as rapidly
as they could pull the triggers of their weapons,
aiming whenever they saw anything to aim at.</p>

<p class='c007'>During all this firing the orders of the sheriff
were implicitly followed. Tom Gray and Lieutenant
Wingate were as steady as rock, for
they had been through skirmishes before. Stacy
was a little excited, but more from eagerness to
be up and at the bandits than from fear. The
bandits were getting desperate. On account of
the interruption there had been no opportunity to
explode another charge of dynamite under the
express car, and they were now too fully engaged
to proceed with that work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The desperadoes knew very well from the
sound that the attackers were using small arms
instead of rifles, thus leaving the advantage with
the bandits so far as weapons were concerned.
The robbers now began creeping stealthily up the
slope, firing at every flash from a revolver, but
Ford’s party was keeping so low that there was
no great danger of any one being hit except as
they changed positions and ran for fresh cover,
which they always did following a volley from the
bandits’ rifles. The sheriff’s party was giving
ground slowly, constantly changing positions
under his orders, the officer himself now and then
running along the line, giving quick low-spoken
orders, without regard to his own safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bandits had been drawn away from the
tracks for some distance when Ford dropped
down beside Hippy Wingate, who was firing from
behind a small boulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it, Sheriff?” questioned Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have a plan,” answered Ford.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good! What is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our revolvers won’t hold them back much
longer. Should they rush us someone is certain
to get hit. In any event we shall then have to
run for it. I don’t like to do that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not yet,” answered Hippy with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think we may be able to save your horses
and the express car if you are willing to take a
long chance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have taken so many already that chances
no longer are a novelty. What is it you wish
me to do?” demanded Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go to the engineer and tell him to back up.
Tell him to hit those three cars as hard as he
dares—hit them as fast as he can without throwing
them from the rails or injuring the horses.
Having done that, let him back down the grade
as quietly as possible so those fellows won’t
notice him. When he hits the express car he is
to keep on backing until he reaches the train,
which he is to push back a full half mile, and
then stop and wait for us to finish our job. When
we have done that we will fire a signal—three
shots at intervals. I reckon the moon will soon
be up so we can see what we are doing. Tell
the engineer, too, that we will fire the same
signal if we approach him, but, should he see anybody
coming up who does not give that signal,
he is to start up his engine and reverse for all
he’s worth. Get me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I get you, Buddy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would go myself, but I am needed here.
When the time comes we shall have to make
a sharp get-away ourselves, but if we save the
train that will be enough. Do you think you can
reach the locomotive?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surest thing you know, old top,” answered
Hippy laughingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be careful! You will find that the engine
is guarded, but I don’t believe there will be more
than two men guarding it, and perhaps this firing
may have drawn them away, though I hardly
think so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Leave it to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Should you miss us on your return, make
for the train as fast as you can. You’re the right
sort, Lieutenant. Pick your own trail and the
best o’ luck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate was off a few seconds later,
running cautiously, now and then flattening himself
on the ground to avoid the occasional volley.
Hippy had no fear of the bullets that whistled
over him, though he had a sufficiently intimate
acquaintance with such missiles to hold them in
high respect. That was why he dropped to the
ground when firing was resumed. In a few
moments he was out of range of the firing. He
then straightened up and ran with all speed,
parallel with the tracks, but keeping several rods
to one side.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he neared the locomotive Hippy proceeded
with more caution. The night was now sufficiently
light to enable him to see the figures of
two men sitting on the bank beside the tracks
on the right side of the engine. There was no
special need for vigilance on their part now, for
ahead of the locomotive a telegraph pole had
been felled across the tracks, while to its rear
were the cars and the bandits. All this made the
guards somewhat careless so that they failed to
see a figure dart across the tracks a few rods back
of the locomotive tender.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate crept along under the
overhang of the tender, on the side opposite
from the two guards. He did not know but there
might be men on that side also, but soon discovered
that there were not. He had crawled to
the running board, by which entrance is gained
to the locomotive cab, before he was discovered
by the fireman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sh-h-h-h!” warned Hippy just in time to
check an exclamation that was on the lips of the
fireman. “Lean over. I have a message for you—for
the engineer. Don’t make a quick move,
but just settle down. You might fire up the
boiler a little. With the glare from the fire in
their eyes those two fellows won’t see quite so
clearly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fireman, after a whispered word to the
engineer, opened the fire door and threw in fresh
coal, then crouched down with his ear close to
the Overland Rider, whereupon Hippy briefly
explained Sheriff Ford’s plan, at the same time
acquainting the fireman with the situation to the
rear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another whispered conversation across the
boiler between engineer and fireman followed,
with Hippy Wingate clinging on the step of the
locomotive in tense expectancy. A sudden hiss
of steam from the cylinders on both sides of the
engine startled him, and the big drive wheels
began slipping on the rails.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey there! What are ye up to?” yelled a
guard, making a leap for the running board.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fireman responded by hieing a chunk of
coal, which caught the bandit in the stomach,
laying the fellow flat in the ditch beside the
tracks. The remaining guard fired point-blank
without effect at the engineer’s window, but the
driver’s head was below the level of the cab
window at that instant. The wheels gained a
foothold, the engine began backing rapidly while
the guard continued to shoot at the reversing
hulk of steel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good for you, Buddies!” cried Hippy enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c007'>The engineer did not slow down as he approached
the scene of the hold-up, knowing that
there were no persons in the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy had dropped off before the engine gained
much headway, and rolled over into the ditch and
soon heard the tender hit the express car.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bandits had heard the engine rumbling
down the grade, but they were too busy shooting
at Sheriff Ford’s party to be able to spare the
time to interfere. In the meantime a new note
had been added to the battle. The train crew,
now taking courage, had gone to the assistance
of the Sheriff, armed with revolvers, shot guns,
iron bars and whatever else they could lay their
hands on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace Harlowe and her friends, in the meantime,
however, remained on guard, and not even
the trainmen could have got into her sleeping car
without giving an account of themselves to the
Overland girls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The firing now grew fast and furious. Hippy
heard it, listened attentively and realized that his
little party was being assisted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must get back and take a hand,” he
muttered, making a wide detour with the intention
of coming in to the rear of Sheriff Ford and his
men. To do this he ran up the ravine from the
railroad, near where the attack had been made.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate had not proceeded far before
he heard what sounded like hoof-beats. At
first he feared that the ponies of his outfit had
been taken; then he realized that this could not
be the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ravine in which he found himself was now
fairly well lighted by the rising moon, and discovery
was certain, the banks on either side being
so steep that the Overlander knew that he could
not look for escape that way. Not caring to be
caught in a trap, Hippy turned and began to
retreat down the ravine, then halted abruptly, as
he discovered a horseman coming up the ravine
at a gallop. A man was running just ahead of
the rider, the latter calling orders to the runner.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this juncture, Lieutenant Wingate unlimbered
his revolver and waited. The two men saw
him, and the runner pointed to him, then dashed
right past Hippy, shielding his face with a hand.
As he passed, the runner fired a shot at Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know you!” yelled the Overlander, sending
a bullet into the ground behind the runner. “I
know your game, you scoundrel!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy, for the moment, apparently had forgotten
the man on horseback, who was now to
the rear of him, for Lieutenant Wingate, upon
discovering the identity of the man on foot, was
so amazed that all other thoughts took flight.</p>

<p class='c007'>All at once the Overland Rider remembered.
He wheeled like a flash and fired at the figure
that was now towering over him. A blow, crushing
in its force, came down on the head of the
Overland Rider, felling him to the ground. The
butt of a rifle in the hands of the horseman was
the instrument that caused Hippy’s undoing.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime, while Hippy was carrying
Ford’s message to the engineer of the Red
Limited, the hot reception they were getting led
the bandits to give up the fight and scatter. It
was one of the fleeing train-robbers who had
struck Lieutenant Wingate down.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chV' class='c008'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />ON THE TRAIL OF THE MISSING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Have the train draw up here and wait
for us,” Sheriff Ford directed, as the
trainmen were about to return to
their train after the bandits had finally been
driven off. “Those ruffians have had enough, and
won’t come back. Some of them are wounded,
too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aren’t you coming with us?” asked a trainman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. I’m going to look for Lieutenant Wingate.
He may be on the train, but, if he is not,
have the engineer give us three whistles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hippy wouldn’t go back without us,” declared
Tom Gray with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go back to your train, men, while we look
for our friend,” urged Sheriff Ford.</p>

<p class='c007'>The train crew lost no time in following Ford’s
advice, being eager to get away from that locality.
Stacy Brown was sent back with them to put on
his clothes. Stacy was shivering in his pajamas,
but the fat boy had done his duty as steadily as
any of his companions, and fully proven his
courage, thus winning the admiration of Sheriff
Ford and Tom Gray. The two other volunteer
passengers, one a salesman for a Chicago grocery
house, the other a Colorado ranchman, announced
their intention of remaining with the sheriff to
assist him in his search.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after the departure of the trainmen,
three long blasts of the locomotive whistle told
the party that Lieutenant Wingate had not returned
to the train.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That settles it, men. It is up to us to get
to work,” declared the sheriff. Ford divided his
forces and sent parties in various directions to
search for the missing Hippy Wingate, hoping,
and partly believing, that the lieutenant had probably
met up with the bandits on their retreat
into the mountains after abandoning their attack
on the train, and secreted himself somewhere in
the vicinity of the attempted hold-up.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders were now in the Sierras, and
the country all about them was wild and uninhabited.
After surveying his surroundings with
critical eyes, Ford took to the ravine up which
Hippy had gone in attempting to get back to his
companions, and soon found the place where the
bandits had staked down their horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two warning whistles, the engineer’s regular
signal that the train was about to start ahead,
caused the sheriff to run down the ravine to the
railroad, at the same time firing three shots to
recall his companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get aboard in a hurry!” shouted the conductor,
leaning from the engine cab as the train
came back to the scene of the attempted robbery.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait! Has Lieutenant Wingate returned?”
demanded Ford.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!” shouted Stacy Brown from the platform
of the smoking car. “Didn’t you find
him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you positive, Stacy?” called Tom Gray,
running up at this juncture.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is not on the train, Tom,” answered Grace
Harlowe from a vestibule doorway. “The engineer
said he dropped off just as the engine began
backing down. Tom, you must search for Hippy.
Nora is nearly wild from worry over him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are going to find him, little woman,” answered
Captain Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you folks going to get aboard?” demanded
the conductor insistently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. We’re not going to leave that man here
by a long shot,” retorted Ford.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right. Stay if you want to. We’re going
ahead,” snapped the conductor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop!” ordered the sheriff. “You hold this
train until I give you leave to move it. I am
an officer of the law, and in command here for the
present. Captain Gray, what do you wish to
do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Find the lieutenant, Sheriff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, would it not be a good idea to unload
your ponies?” asked Ford. “We may have to
be here until tomorrow, and perhaps make a long
journey into the interior, which we cannot well
do on foot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. We will unload enough animals to carry
your party,” answered Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pull your train up to the mouth of the ravine
and stop,” commanded Ford, clambering aboard
the locomotive. “Get aboard there, boys.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The train promptly pulled ahead while the
sheriff had his final argument with the conductor
in the locomotive cab. The argument was brief,
but heated, the sheriff laying down the law to
the angry conductor, who, by the time his train
had reached the mouth of the ravine, was wholly
subdued.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overland Riders stepped off the train to
watch the unloading of the ponies and to get
instructions from Tom and Mr. Ford.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are about twenty-five miles from Gardner,”
said the sheriff, addressing Grace. “You
people, I believe, intend to detrain there. Have
someone unload your stock and then wait until
we return. You will find a very fair little hotel
at Gardner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will wait,” answered Grace composedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ford called upon the train crew to assist in
unloading the ponies. Unloading boards were
obtained from the baggage car with which a
rather substantial gangway was constructed, and
down it the light-footed ponies—five of them—were
led without the least difficulty. Rifles and
light equipment for the party were unloaded, the
rest of the Overlanders’ property and two ponies
being left on the train.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the unloading was in progress Tom Gray
went to the dining car and purchased provisions,
consisting of canned goods, pork and beans and a
side of bacon. Stacy Brown, who had gone back
to the sleeping car for something he wanted from
his suitcase, dropped in while Tom was bartering,
and helped his companion carry back their purchases.
By the time they reached the head of
the train all was in readiness for the departure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ford waved the lantern that he had borrowed
from the conductor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go ahead,” he called to the conductor. “Mrs.
Gray, don’t forget to report to Gardner what has
become of us. If we are not back in two days
have them send a posse for us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I understand,” answered Grace Harlowe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I say, you! You might have Emma do a
little transmigrating for us while we’re away.
I reckon we’ll be needing it,” called back Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the train pulled out, the passengers, including
the girls of the Overland party, were
gathered on the platforms cheering. The searching
party now consisted, besides Sheriff Ford,
of Tom Gray, Stacy Brown and the two passengers
who had been with them from the first,
making five in all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, sir, what is your plan?” demanded Tom
after they had saddled and made ready to start.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think we will follow up the ravine for a
little way,” answered the sheriff. “Your man
went this way. I know because the fireman saw
him take to the ravine. One of you lead my
horse; I’m going ahead on foot with the lantern.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you have no objection, I will go with
you,” offered Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ford nodded, and the two started away, the
others, on the ponies, keeping well to the rear.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two men in advance finally reached the
point in the ravine where Lieutenant Wingate
had been struck down. With lantern held close
to the ground, the sheriff went over it on hands
and knees, examining every foot of the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stand where you are until I come back,” he
directed, addressing Tom Gray. “Do you recognize
this?” he asked, holding up a hat, upon his
return a few moments later.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is the lieutenant’s hat,” answered Tom
promptly, and Stacy Brown agreed with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the use of a hat without a head to
wear it?” demanded Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This!” replied Ford. “I have proved one
thing. Our man came this way, but beyond this
point the only trace of him is the hat. Unless I
am much mistaken, he left here on the back of
a horse, and he went that way.” The sheriff
pointed up the ravine. “It is fair to assume that
he did not go voluntarily. The only inference
possible, then, is that he has been taken.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captured by the bandits!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ford nodded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For what reason?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Candidly, I don’t know, Captain. We have
got to find out, and it is advisable for us to go in
search of the answer to that question as fast as
we can. We will mount and move on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose I am the one who will have to
furnish the brains for this party and find the
missing man,” declared Stacy pompously, but no
one laughed at his sally.</p>

<p class='c007'>A minute later they were mounted and on their
way up the ravine, the sheriff still carrying the
lantern, which he held low, keeping his gaze
constantly on the trail, which still was fairly plain
and easy for an experienced man to follow. Stacy
dropped behind a little way and produced a plum
pudding can from his pocket. Opening the can,
he calmly proceeded to eat the pudding.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s that you’re eating?” demanded one
of the two passengers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pudding. A plum one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where did you get it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, back there in the diner,” answered Stacy
carelessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You stole a pudding, eh?” laughed the
questioner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my; no, sir. How could you think such
a thing? Don’t you know I wouldn’t do anything
like that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! You paid for it,” nodded the passenger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not. Captain Gray did. You see it
was this way. The captain paid for six cans of
baked beans, but they gave him only five cans.
The colored gentleman in the diner cheated us
out of one can, and probably pocketed the difference,
so I sort of helped myself to a pudding
to even things up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph! You are a young man of unusual
ability. You should have been a lawyer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it,” admitted Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>An exclamation from Ford interrupted the
conversation. The sheriff had picked up a handkerchief
which Tom thought belonged to Hippy
Wingate. They believed that the lieutenant
had dropped it purposely, knowing full well that
pursuit would follow promptly when his friends
discovered that he was missing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are on the trail all right,” cried the
sheriff. “Look sharp and don’t make much noise
about it, either.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Daybreak found the outfit still in the saddle.
Now that they could see, Ford threw away the
lantern, and, after watering their ponies at a
mountain spring, they pressed on with all speed.
The men ate a cold breakfast in the saddle, there
being no time to waste in halting to cook breakfast.
Further, the smoke from a camp-fire would
be a danger signal to the men for whom they were
searching.</p>

<p class='c007'>About nine o’clock in the morning the sheriff
and Tom found a split-trail. The two trails led
up a steep incline to a small plateau. There
they discovered the remains of a camp-fire. Ford
dismounted and ran his fingers through the ashes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There has been a fire here within a few
hours,” he announced.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the trail has gone to pieces,” added
Stacy Brown who had got down from his pony
and begun nosing about.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The bandits have taken different directions
from here, haven’t they?” questioned the sheriff,
glancing up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. I’ll tell you what let’s do. Let’s shut
our eyes and let the ponies decide which trail to
take,” suggested Chunky gravely. “My Bismarck
can follow the trail of a squirrel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is not a squirrel trail,” answered Ford
briefly. “There are five of us men here. Four
will take separate trails while one remains here.
Let each man follow his trail for, say, three hours,
then, whether or not he has discovered anything,
he will return to this point. We can then decide
upon further action.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have an idea that the bandits discovered
that they were being followed,” suggested one of
the two passengers. “Otherwise, why should
they split up and take different trails?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. I agree with you,” nodded the sheriff.
Mr. Ford decided that one of the passenger
volunteers should remain behind, then assigned
the other passenger and Tom, Stacy and himself
to follow the bandits’ trails, Ford selecting what
seemed to be the most promising trail for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Full understanding of what each one was to do
was had, then the four rode away, leaving their
guard where he could see, yet remain hidden.</p>

<p class='c007'>The four trails led on for five miles without
a break. Stacy, full of importance because of the
duty assigned to him, was watching his trail
closely, and, had he been less observant, he might
have missed the point where the trail again split.
Discovering this, he halted and sat regarding the
two trails with solemn eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sharp trick,” he nodded. “It doesn’t fool
Stacy Brown, though.” He decided that the
left-hand trail swung over towards the one that Tom
Gray was riding, perhaps joining it a short distance
from the junction where Stacy was at that
moment. Having come to this conclusion, the
fat boy had a bright idea. He would take a short
cut across country. He knew that this was a
risky thing to do, but he had several mountain
peaks for landmarks and did not believe that he
could go astray, so he started full of confidence,
leaving both trails behind him.</p>

<p class='c007'>An hour-and-a-half passed. Stacy still had
thirty minutes to ride before it would be time for
him to turn back towards the starting point,
as he learned by consulting his watch, and he
decided to make the most of those thirty minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There! Didn’t I tell you?” he cried as he
rode out into an open space and instantly discovered
the hoof-prints of several horses on the
soft ground. “I was positive that I couldn’t be
wrong. My time is up, but I have found the spot
where the rascals got together. Now I’ll just
turn about and follow it home. This is the trail
we must follow to find Uncle Hip. Yes, I’ll go
back and report.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy Brown’s intentions were good, and, well
satisfied with what he had accomplished, he rode
along humming softly to himself, now and then
confiding his opinions to his pony. The little
animal wiggled its ears as if it understood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hulloa! There goes the sun. Seven o’clock!
Who would have thought it? According to my
watch I’ve been back at the forks for a quarter of
an hour. I wonder if I really have?” Stacy regarded
his surroundings narrowly. “No. I never
saw any of you mountain-peak fellows before. I
must have made a mistake in my reckonings, but
I’ve got a biscuit in my pocket, and we’ll be able
to go quite a distance on one biscuit, especially
on this kind of a biscuit. Some biscuits go a
great deal farther than others. This is one of
the farther kind,” finished Chunky, performing
a series of contortions as he tried to break off a
piece of biscuit with his teeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pony was laboring up a steep incline, the
stirrup straps creaking in rhythm with the
animal’s quick, short steps, Stacy’s body, from the
belt up, bobbing upwards and backwards with
monotonous regularity. The reins lay over the
saddle pommel, thus giving the pony’s head full
play and enabling it to snatch a mouthful of
greens here and there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly the little animal threw its head up
and snorted. Stacy Brown ceased munching and
sat staring wide-eyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suffering cats! You’re IT, Stacy Brown!”
he gasped.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jerking his rifle from the saddle-boot he fired
three quick shots over the head of his pony.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVI' class='c008'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />CHUNKY MEETS THE BANDITS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The pony had nosed its way around the
base of a high rock, fetching up on a
meadow, when Stacy made the discovery
that startled him. What he saw was a
group of men sitting about a cook-fire, hurriedly
eating a meal while their ponies grazed on the
mountain grass some distance from the fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy knew instantly that he had stumbled
upon the bandits. He realized, too, in those brief
seconds, that he must be a long way from the
place where he was to meet his companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The desperadoes saw the intruder about the
time that Chunky saw them. Used to emergencies
and quick action, the men sprang for their
rifles, which were standing against a boulder near
at hand. Chunky also saw that Lieutenant Wingate
was not with them. Had the boy thought
twice he would have held his fire, but, as it
turned out, his shots served a good purpose. It
startled the bandits, causing momentary confusion,
which gave Stacy an opportunity to head in
an opposite direction, which he was not slow in
doing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye-o-o-o-ow!” howled the fat boy in a shrill,
piercing voice. The shots and the yells startled
the bandits’ ponies as it had their owners. The
horses threw up their heads, snorted and galloped
into the mountain meadow, fully twenty
rods from the camp, while the boy threw himself
on the neck of his pony, fully expecting a shot
or a volley from them, and dashed around the
base of a high rock at a perilous pace. He had
no more than reached the protection of the rock
than the <i>pock, pock</i> of rifle bullets, as they hit
the rock to his rear, reached his ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, wow!” howled Chunky. “I lost my
biscuit.” In ordinary circumstances he would
have gone back to look for the biscuit, but just
now Stacy was in somewhat of a hurry. Fortunately
for the boy, it took the bandits fully
twenty minutes to round up their horses, by
which time the fat boy was far in the lead, riding
like mad. He had lost all sense of direction, but
perhaps the pony had not. The little animal
had taken affairs into its own control and was
laying out its own trail.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bandits, instead of following, rode with all
speed farther into the mountains, but Chunky
continued on at his same perilous pace, even
though darkness had now overtaken him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whoa, Bismarck!” commanded Chunky
finally, reining in his pony. “Do you know
where you’re going, or don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The pony rattled the bit between its teeth,
tossed its head up and down, and uttered a loud
whinny.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You said ‘yes,’ didn’t you? All right, if you
know where you are, go along. You surely can’t
know any less about it than I do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rider and mount resumed their journey at a
somewhat slower pace, and rode on until Stacy
was brought to a sudden stop by a sharp, gruff
word of command.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Halt!” ordered a voice just ahead of him.
The pony gave a startled jump that nearly unhorsed
its rider.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, wow!” howled Chunky, and on the impulse
of the moment he fired two quick shots at
the sound.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop it! It’s Tom Gray. Haven’t you any
more sense than to blaze away before you know
at what you are shooting?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, fiddlesticks! Had you been through
what I have you would shoot at the drop of the
hat. Are you lost, too?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lost? I am not lost. Don’t you know where
you are?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. I might be in the suburbs of Chillicothe
for all I know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The camp is only a few rods away,” Tom
Gray informed him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t say?” wondered Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We heard you coming, and thought it might
be Mr. Ford. How did you happen to come in
over that trail?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ask Bismarck. He knows all about it. I
don’t. Got any news about Uncle Hip?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. Of course you saw nothing of either him
or the bandits.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I not only found the robbers, but I had a
battle with them,” answered Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s that? Don’t trifle, Brown. This is a
serious matter,” rebuked Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m telling you the truth. It was this way.
I was riding along, peaceful like, when, all of a
sudden, biff, boom, bang! It seemed to me that
fifty or a hundred men burst from the bushes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So many as that?” laughed Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, something like that. I may be a dozen
or so out of the way, but you see I didn’t stop
to count them. I raised my trusty rifle and—well,
to make a long story short, I fired right into
that howling bunch of bandits. I suppose I
emptied as many as twelve saddles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait a moment,” urged one of the travelers
who had joined them. “How many times did
you reload?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all. I didn’t have time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Captain Gray, he emptied twelve saddles, so
he must have shot two men with each bullet, as
his magazine holds only six cartridges. I call that
some shooting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that so? Then I must have done as you
say. Wonderful, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this juncture, Sheriff Ford rode into camp
and was quickly told of what Stacy had discovered.
Mr. Ford, after a few quick questions,
realized that the boy really had stumbled on the
right trail and discovered the bandits.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did well, young man,” he complimented.
“I thought I had struck a lead, but the trail
pinched out. Can you take us to the place where
you came on those ruffians?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, but the pony can, or you can follow my
trail. I reckon I left a pretty plain one. I know
Uncle Hip better than you do, and if he has been
able to get away from the fellows who captured
him I’ll guarantee that he will find us. He would
know we wouldn’t go away and leave him. For
that reason I suggest that we build a fire to attract
Uncle Hip’s attention, should he be in this
vicinity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the men protested, saying it would be
dangerous, but the sheriff agreed with Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will have a fire and will post guards to
protect ourselves,” he said. “We shall not be
bothered by the bandits to-night; I am positive
of that. They know that the alarm has been
given and that, in all probability, a posse is
already on their trail. If nothing develops during
the night—if we get no news from Lieutenant
Wingate—we will start for Gardner in the morning
and organize a big searching party to comb
the mountains for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After all phases of the situation had been discussed,
the sheriff’s plan was agreed to, and a fire
was built up. It had been blazing for some time
when, in a lull in the conversation, Stacy was reminded
that he had not finished telling about his
meeting with the bandits.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. You left off with shooting two men
with each bullet,” laughed Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the excitement of meeting up with the
villains,” resumed Stacy, without an instant’s
hesitation, “I wheeled the pony—spun him
about on his hind feet like a top, set him down on
all fours and dashed away. We didn’t gallop,
we simply dashed. You know it wasn’t that I
was afraid. Anyone who knows me knows that
nothing can scare me. I—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Bang, bang, bang!</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, wow!” howled the fat boy, diving head
first into a clump of bushes where he crouched
wide-eyed, the chill creepers chasing up and down
his spinal column. The others of the party
sprang up and snatched their rifles, Ford kicking
the blazing wood of the camp-fire aside, and Tom
Gray dousing it with a pail of water.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lie low, everybody, till I find out what this
means!” commanded the sheriff sharply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are—are we attacked? Have the scoundrels
come back?” chattered Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be quiet!” Mr. Ford crept out into the
darkness, the others waiting in tense expectancy
listening for a rifle volley.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom thought the shots they had heard were
signals, but no one else believed such to be the
case.</p>

<p class='c007'>The flash of a revolver, a sharp report close at
hand, was followed by a shout from Stacy Brown
and two shots from his own weapon at a shadowy
moving figure skulking behind a clump of
bushes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVII' class='c008'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />BANDITS CATCH A TARTAR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The blow on the head had left Lieutenant
Wingate unconscious. Without loss of
a minute he was thrown over the back of
the horse, in front of the rider, like a sack of meal
on its way home from the mill, then the horse
started away at a trot.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a few moments of violent jolting, consciousness
began to return to Hippy and he groped
for something to take hold of to relieve the strain
of his trying position. His fingers finally gripped
the boot of his captor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quick as a flash, the bandit brought down the
butt of his revolver on the captive’s head, whereupon
Hippy went to sleep again, the blood trickling
from nose and mouth. Other riders, in the
meantime, had caught up with and passed the
rider who was carrying him away. From what
was said it was apparent that Hippy’s captor was
the leader of the party, for the others deferred to
his commands, and, riding on ahead, soon disappeared.
The trail grew more and more rugged.
On the right a solid granite wall rose sheer for
several hundred feet, while on the left, the side
over which Hippy’s head was hanging, the ground
dropped away sharply for fully three hundred
feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate again began to recover
consciousness. It seemed to him as if all the
blood in his body were concentrated in his aching
head and neck. He did not realize at the moment
how the arms and hands were smarting from being
dragged through bushes and against the rough
edges of rocks, but he did discover that two large
lumps had been raised on his head, one well down
towards the base of the brain. Had the second
blow been an inch farther down, it probably would
have killed him.</p>

<p class='c007'>His head becoming clearer, Hippy began to
consider his situation—to think what he could
do to extricate himself from his uncomfortable
and perilous position. His train of thought was
suddenly interrupted by an exclamation from the
bandit and a sharp pressure of a spur against the
pony’s side. Hippy could feel the rider’s leg contract
as the spur was driven home. The pony
reared and threatened to buck, but, evidently
changing its mind, started away at a jolting trot.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interruption had served one good purpose:
it had given Hippy an opportunity to get one
hand up to his shirt, where the hand fumbled for
a few perilous seconds, then dropped cautiously
to its former position. That hand now held a
pin. Miserable as he was, Hippy smiled grimly
and pricked the pony’s side with the pin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bandit roared as the animal jumped, and
again applied the spur, followed instantly by a
jab of Hippy’s new weapon, the pin. A lively
few seconds ensued, and the pony bucked so
effectively that its rider had all he could do to
stick to the saddle, and at the same time manage
his captive and the reins. Hippy jabbed the pin
in again and again, though every buck of the
animal nearly broke the Overlander in two.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few seconds of this treatment and the end
came suddenly. With a final humping of its back
in a buck that lifted all four feet from the ground,
the pony went up into the air with arching back
and with head held stiffly close to its forefeet.
The bandit threw all the strength of one hand
into an effort to jerk that stubborn head back
where it belonged, while the other hand grabbed
desperately for the body of the captive, which
was slowly slipping away. The bandit, as a result,
came a cropper over the pony’s head. Hippy
wriggled and slipped off, shooting head first down
the sharp incline of smooth rocks that fell away
from the left side of the trail. The pony galloped
away a few rods; then, halting, gazed about him
uneasily.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bandit, after a few dazed seconds, got up
and started for his mount, then halting suddenly
began searching for his captive. Hippy Wingate
was nowhere in sight, though his captor found
where his body had crushed down the bushes as it
slipped from the trail. The bandit finally gave
it up, and, catching his pony, quickly rode away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No use. He’s done for,” growled the man before
leaving the scene. “He’s gone clear to the
bottom, mashed flat as a flapjack.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hoof-beats of the pony had no sooner died
away than Hippy Wingate’s head was cautiously
raised from behind the roots of a tree that clung
to the side of the mountain, gripped into a deep
crevice for anchorage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not a flapjack just yet, old top,” he
muttered. “I may be if I am not careful how
I move about. I suppose I ought to hang on
here till daylight, but those fellows may come
back. They can’t afford to let me get away. I
know too much.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic002'>
<img src='images/img1.jpg' alt='' class='ig002' />
<p>“No Use. He’s Done For!”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Hippy began crawling cautiously toward the
trail, and finally gaining it, sat down to think over
what he had better do next. He felt for his revolver
and was relieved to find that it had not
been taken from him, and thus fortified, he decided
that the prudent course would be to find a hiding
place and wait there for daylight, so he started
away, taking the back track, which he followed
until it had so widened that he was unable to keep
to the trail. He then branched off to the right,
holding as straight a course as possible. The
trickle of water caught his ear, and, a moment
later, Hippy was flat on his stomach, drinking
long, deep draughts from a tiny mountain stream.
He then bathed his face and head and his smarting,
swollen arms. He knew that he ought to be
moving, but what direction to take was the question.
Being a good woodsman, he knew that to
wander aimlessly about in the night surely would
result in losing himself completely.</p>

<p class='c007'>After searching about for some time, Lieutenant
Wingate found a high rock suited to his purpose.
He climbed up and sat down.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The scoundrels will have to move quickly
if they get me this time,” he muttered.
“They’ll—” Hippy’s head drooped, and he
sank slowly to the rock fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he again opened his eyes the sun was
shining down into them, and his cheeks felt as
if they were on fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Morning! Who would think it?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without wasting time, he made his way back
to the stream where he drank and bathed. Now
came the question as to the course he should
follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is probable that some of my outfit will
remain by the railroad where the hold-up occurred,”
he reflected. “That’s where I am going.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After a final look at the sun, Hippy started
back briskly. He did not follow the trail, believing
that he could find a more direct course,
and that such a course eventually would lead him
to the railroad a short distance to the west of
where he had been the previous evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was nearly noon when Hippy first began to
realize that he was hungry. He had not thought
of breakfast, nor would it have done him any
good had he thought of it. An hour later he
found a berry bush and ate all the fruit it held.
That helped a little and he again plodded on.
About four o’clock that afternoon he reached the
railroad, and, not long after that, he was trotting
around the bend to the scene of the hold-up. The
place was deserted. Hippy fired a signal from
his revolver and listened. There was no reply.
A rabbit hopped across the tracks. He fired twice
at it, missing each time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There goes my supper!” he exclaimed ruefully.
“Next time I sight game I’ll throw a stone
at it. I reckon I can throw stones better than
I can shoot. I should have thought my friends
would wait for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy did discover where the Overland ponies
had been unloaded, then he understood that his
companions had gone in search of him. This
knowledge heartened him up a great deal, and he
immediately set himself to work to discover which
way the party had gone. What he was looking
for was the trail of his own pony, whose shoeprints
he believed he would be able to identify
instantly. Hippy picked up the trail in a remarkably
short time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here I go. I’ve got to travel some if I am
to catch them before dark,” he cried, starting
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Darkness found Lieutenant Wingate wandering
aimlessly near the place where the trail forked
and where his companions were now discussing
their further plans for the morrow. He concluded
that he would have to spend another night in the
open and alone, and had just ensconced himself
on the highest ledge he could find when he caught
sight of the light from Sheriff Ford’s camp-fire.
Hippy gazed at it for some moments, then raised
his revolver and fired three shots.</p>

<p class='c007'>The camp-fire was suddenly blotted out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There! I’ve shot out the fire,” he grumbled.
“Just the same, I don’t believe it is the bandit
camp, and I’m going down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Moving with extreme caution, Hippy crept
down the mountain-side until he believed that he
was near the place where he had seen the fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon there’s nothing doing, boys,” Ford
was saying. “Light the fire, but keep a sharp
lookout.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy got up. Stacy’s keen eyes discovered
him and the fat boy fired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hi, there! Cut the firing! It’s Hippy,”
called Lieutenant Wingate, ducking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, wow!” howled Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>A shout went up from the searching party when
Hippy called out his warning, and he was fairly
dragged into camp where Sheriff Ford hurriedly
started a cook-fire and put over coffee as a starter.
While this was being done, Lieutenant Wingate
briefly related the story of his capture and
escape.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You say you know the man who was on foot
when you were taken?” asked Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give me one guess and see if I can name
him,” spoke up Sheriff Ford, straightening up,
frying-pan in hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s yours. Who is he?” laughed Lieutenant
Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our story-telling friend of the Red Limited,
William Sylvester Holmes,” replied Ford confidently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You win,” chuckled Hippy. “How did you
guess it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was suspicious of him all the time. At
Summit my suspicions were, in a way, confirmed.
He sent telegrams from there that, I now believe,
informed the gang about the treasure car.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was there really a treasure car on the train,
Ford?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You might call it that. There was nearly
three million dollars in gold on that car. Pretty
good haul, eh? I reckon the authorities of this
county will be glad to hear what you have to tell
them. I will go to Gardner with you and we’ll
have a confab with the sheriff there, if you will
spare the time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure we will,” spoke up Stacy. “We riders
have to keep busy, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It strikes me that you have been rather busy
since I first met you,” returned the sheriff.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are your wishes, to go through to-night
or wait until morning and get an early start?” he
asked the two passengers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll flag a train for myself down by the bend
and you men can ride through. You can’t miss
the way. There is a good trail all the way
from here to Gardner, and you should be there by
early afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The two passengers said that, if the sheriff
would flag the train for them, they would prefer
to go by train too, as they were in haste to reach
their destination on the coast, important business
awaiting them there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right. I’ll flag the next train after we
get to the rails and put you two men aboard. I
can then ride through with these three Overland
men. I’d prefer a hoss to a Pullman any time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The party made themselves as comfortable as
they could, sleeping on the ground, and before
daylight next morning Mr. Ford had breakfast
ready. Hippy was stiff and his hat hurt his head,
but he made light of his discomfiture and was
ready for the start which was made before sunup.
Ford made good his word to stop the next
train, which proved to be a local, and there was
not so much grumbling by the train crew as there
would have been had the train been a limited
one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The horseback ride that day was a hard one,
but all were used to the saddle, and Sheriff Ford,
himself a “rough-rider,” was interested in the
riding of the three Overlanders. By this time he
had grown to understand Stacy Brown better,
and his laughter at the boy’s sallies was loud and
appreciative. Late in the afternoon the delayed
party rode into Gardner where a warm welcome
awaited them from the Overland girls, who had
already arranged for a posse to go out to look for
the missing ones.</p>

<p class='c007'>The authorities were keenly interested in the
information that Sheriff Ford and the three Overland
men had to offer, and declared their intention
of starting out in an effort to round up the gang.
That evening there was a genuine reunion of the
Overlanders at which their further plans were discussed.
It was left to Hippy to find a guide,
while Stacy was to select the pack animals, and
the girls the food and other equipment for the
journey. The results of their quests were destined
to furnish much amusement on the following
day.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chVIII' class='c008'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />HEADED FOR THE HIGH COUNTRY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I have found a guide,” announced Hippy
next morning, walking into the post office
where he found all the other members of
his party writing postal cards to friends in the
east.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s good. Where is he?” asked Tom
Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you will look up you will see him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders looked. Just to the rear of
Hippy Wingate stood a grinning Chinaman, both
hands hidden in the ends of his flowing sleeves.
The Oriental was bowing and scraping, his queue
animatedly bobbing up and down. Stacy uttered
a loud “Ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Permit me to introduce to you the Honorable
Woo Smith whom I have selected, subject to your
approval, to accompany us on our journey to the
High Sierras,” announced Hippy Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But surely, Hippy, this man cannot be a
guide,” protested Elfreda Briggs. “We need a
guide!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps he isn’t, but you can’t find anything
else with a magnifying glass in this burg. Should
you folks think best not to accept him, we’ll go it
alone. I’ve done the best I can. Remember, too,
that I’m a sick man, that I’ve been mauled and
keelhauled by a bunch of bandits and—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you speak English?” interrupted Grace
Harlowe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Les. Me speak English velly fine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You say his name is Woo Smith?” questioned
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Honorable Woo Smith,” Hippy informed
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What has he done in the way of mountain
work?” persisted Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am informed that he has made frequent
journeys to the mountains with prospecting
parties and hunters as cook, guide and general
handy man. At one time he was out with a
government survey party.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As cook or guide?” interjected Nora Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The former, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This outfit needs a good cook,” suggested
Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woo, do you know horses?” asked Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Les.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That reminds me, Chunky, what have you
done about the pack animals?” demanded
Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Got three dandies. I have learned that we
must travel light. They say that the trails are
very rough in the High Country, and further,
that we must depend upon the country for our
food, generally speaking. I don’t know what
Uncle Hip and I are going to do if it comes to
short rations. Of course, as a last resort we can
eat the pack-horses. They eat horses in France,
so why shouldn’t we do the same, if we’re hungry
enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That reminds me. One of the men out with
us on our search for Hippy declared that our
ponies would not be suitable for this journey,
and that it requires animals accustomed to the
peculiarities of the Sierras,” averred Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, pooh!” grunted the fat boy. “My pony
could climb a tree.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How much money do you wish, Woo?”
questioned Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Five dollah a week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you say, good people?” asked Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t care what you do,” exclaimed Hippy.
“I want food and I want someone who knows how
to cook it fit for human consumption, that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I second the motion,” agreed Stacy. “We
can’t all live on soul-transmigration stuff. I’d
get mental indigestion on that food in thirty seconds
by the watch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We had a Chinaman on our journey across
the Great American Desert, and he was an excellent
man,” declared Elfreda Briggs. “I move
that we take this one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The others agreed with her, and Grace, turning
to Woo, told him that he was engaged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What has been done about the general
equipment?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace said that experienced men had advised
against the Overlanders burdening themselves
with tents or any heavy equipment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have slept in the open many times before,
so I think we shall be able to get along very
nicely,” she added.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy Brown protested vigorously. He declared
that he would not sleep out of doors where bugs
and other undesirable things could get at him,
but, after discussing the matter further, every one
agreed that the tents would prove an unnecessary
encumbrance. They went over their list critically,
eliminating several articles that they
thought they could do without.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have an idea!” exclaimed Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep it,” urged Emma. “They seem to be
reasonably scarce with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At least I don’t transmigrate them,” retorted
Chunky. “As I was about to remark when
interrupted, I have an idea that this outfit will
have to browse with the horses if it wishes food.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would be a great flesh-reducer,” murmured
Emma, giving Chunky a sidelong glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Elfreda suggested that they have a look at the
pack-horses selected by Stacy, so they all walked
over to the corral, and expressed themselves as
well satisfied with Stacy’s selections. One white,
mischievous little animal, with a circle of delicate
pink about each eye, they named Kitty. The
name seemed to fit her. The other two animals
they, decided to name later on after learning their
peculiarities.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve ordered pack saddles for them,” announced
Hippy, “and a pair of kyacks for each
horse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is a kyack? Something good to eat?”
questioned Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A kyack is an alforgas,” Emma Dean informed
him. “I am amazed at your ignorance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I agree with you, Emma. For once I do,”
nodded Hippy. “For your information, Stacy, a
kyack is a packing outfit. These are made either
of heavy canvas or of rawhide, shaped square and
dried over boxes. After drying, the boxes are removed,
leaving the stiff rawhide or canvas, like
small trunks, open at the top. They are in
reality sacks—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy klyack,” chuckled the Chinaman,
rubbing his palms together gleefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Smith knows,” nodded Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The explanation is not satisfactory. Once
more I rise to ask if this kyack thing is some sort
of dried beef that we are expected to eat when
real food is scarce?” insisted Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You and I, lad, would have to be pretty
hungry to eat a kyack,” laughed Hippy. “The
loops of the kyack are slung on each side of the
horse. They are used to pack belongings over
the mountains. I have also ordered sawbuck
trees for the pack-saddles, together with pack-cinch,
and pack-rope for each animal. I also took
the liberty of buying blankets from which to make
saddle-pads. It will be cheaper than trying to
get along with horses with sore backs, I think.
Then there are hobbles for the horses, a couple
of cow bells—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are we going to take cows along with us?”
wondered Chunky, opening his eyes a little wider.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not quite. Only a calf or two,” murmured
Emma Dean.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The bells are for the horses, so that they may
be easily found in the morning,” spoke up Tom
Gray. “I thought you had been out before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have, but never with such an outfit as this,
especially the transmigration end of it,” retorted
Stacy, giving Emma a quick look to see if his shot
had gone home. “I see,” he added. “But every
time I hear the bells a-ringing, I shall think of
home and a pitcherful of warm milk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perfectly proper food for the species to which
I so recently referred,” observed Emma airily.
“However, from all accounts, you will have
nothing more nourishing than snow-water from
the tall peaks of the Sierras.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Br-r-r-r!” shivered Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Hippy’s direction, the Honorable Woo Smith
led the pack-horses over to the general store, and
there, with Stacy to assist him, Hippy began
packing their equipment, throwing a diamond
hitch about each pack. The girls, observing the
work, discovered that Stacy Brown was quite as
familiar with “throwing packs” as was his Uncle
Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mister Brown is not quite the fool he would
have us believe,” declared Elfreda Briggs. “It
is my opinion that he believes in putting his worst
foot forward, keeping the other one hidden behind
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A group of mountaineers were standing near,
observing the operations with interest. One
stepped up and examined the much-worn saddle
on Hippy Wingate’s pony.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Son,” said he, “do ye reckon on climbin’
mountains with that thing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not?” demanded Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon it might be all right for the Rockies,
but yer saddle’ll be on the critter’s tail afore ye
git half way to the top of the Big Sierras.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy stroked his chin reflectively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You mean I ought to have a double-cinch on
the riding saddles? Is that it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, Buddy. I’ll fix it. I should have
thought of that, but I am not at all familiar with
the lay of the land up here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye will be, pardner, after ye’ve fell off it a
few thousand times. The landscape in these here
parts be rather sudden in spots,” drawled the
mountaineer.</p>

<p class='c007'>A yell from the Honorable Woo Smith interrupted
the dialogue. Kitty, the mischievous
pack-horse, had playfully seized the queue of Woo
Smith between her teeth and was jerking her head
up and down, and, with each jerk, the Chinaman
was jolted backwards, howling lustily, chattering
in volleys in his native tongue. The street, near
the village store, filled with cowboys and citizens
as if by magic. They set up yells, shouts and cat-cries
that smothered the chatter of the new guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace, being nearest to the mischievous animal,
sprang forward and gave the white pack-horse a
smart slap with the flat of her hand on Kitty’s
plump stomach. The mare instantly dropped the
howling Chinaman, and, whirling on Grace with
wide open mouth, looked as if she were about to
devour the Overland Rider. The girl never
flinched.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself, Kitty?” she
chided. “If ever I see you do a thing like that
again I’ll surely have you punished. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The mare’s mouth closed slowly, her upper lip
quivered, she nibbled gingerly at Grace Harlowe’s
sleeve, and looked as meek as was possible for a
mischievous pony to look. The cowboys grunted
disgustedly. They were disgruntled that Grace
had spoiled their fun, disappointed that the white
mare had not taken a large slice, either out of the
Chinaman or Grace Harlowe herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Grace, do you know, you have given us a most
remarkable demonstration of the transmigration
of thought,” declared Emma. “It was your
thought, transmitted to the mentality of the white
mare, that caused her to desist, to beg of you to
forgive and—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yeo-o-o-o-ow!” howled Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Young man, your rudeness is inexcusable,”
rebuked Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what the white mare wanted to say to
Grace,” retorted Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>While all this was taking place, Tom and
Elfreda were talking with the mountaineers, getting
all the information they could about trails
and conditions in the mountains. The result of
the information gleaned was that the Overland
Riders decided that they would take the “Cold
Stream Trail” for the High Country, a section
seldom visited, but which Woo Smith declared he
knew all about. The spectators were inclined to
make sport of the explorers, and especially of the
idea that women could ride the Sierras. Even the
postmaster sought to dissuade them from making
the attempt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a bad country,” he confided to Tom.
“With that bunch of gals on your hands, you’ll
starve to death, sure’s you’re a foot high.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is plenty of game there, is there not?”
questioned Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, for them that knows how to shoot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I reckon we will not starve. What
other objection is there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Jones Boys. You watch out right smart
for them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who are they?” demanded Elfreda, who had
been an interested listener to the conversation
between Tom and the postmaster.</p>

<p class='c007'>The postmaster glanced about him apprehensively
before replying, then, leaning towards
Tom, spoke in a half-whisper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Outlaws!” he said. “I reckon you’ve heard
of them. It is suspected that they’re the fellows
that held up the Red Limited the other night. I
reckon you know something about that affair.”
The postmaster squinted knowingly at Tom, who
nodded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, that’s it, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Better look out for them. They have
their hang-out somewhere in the mountains, but
nobody has ever been able to trail them to it,
and I don’t reckon no one ever will—and come
back to tell about it. A squad of Pinkerton detectives
went into the mountains looking for those
fellows, but not one of that bunch of detectives
has ever been heard from since.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It sounds shivery, doesn’t it?” spoke up
Elfreda. “However, we have no especial reason
to fear the bandits because there could be no object
in their interfering with us. We do not
carry money with us—not enough to make it
worth their while to try to rob us—nor are we
looking for trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No object!” exploded the postmaster.
“Lady, those fellows would kill you for two bits
and a piece of string.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In his own mind, Tom Gray was not so positive
that the bandits had no reason for interfering with
them. On the contrary, if the Jones Boys knew
that it was the Overland Riders who had assisted
in driving them from the scene of the attempted
train robbery, the Overlanders might confidently
look for some stirring times in the High Sierras.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chIX' class='c008'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />THEIR SLUMBERS DISTURBED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“All aboard for the High Sierras!”
called Stacy Brown, swinging to his
saddle a few minutes later. The
others, one by one, mounted and sat awaiting the
order to start.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woo Smith had gone on ahead. Scorning the
use of a pony to ride, he had trotted on, shooing
the pack-horses along, the departure of the Overlanders
having been deferred until about an hour
after he had left them. Woo said that he would
make camp at a good place and have supper ready
upon their arrival.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders finally started away, waving
their hands to the curious natives, and soon
reached the trail that led towards the High
Country. The trail was an old one, but so seldom
used that it could hardly be dignified by the name
of trail. Woo plainly was familiar with it, for he
had reached it by the most direct course, marking
the beginning of it by breaking over branches of
bushes, a trick that he had learned from white
men with whom he had explored the mountains
at some previous time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very good time was made that day, and when
about eighteen miles from Gardner they saw the
smoke of Woo’s camp-fire. Half an hour later
they reached it and found that the guide had
selected an ideal camping place. There was water
and good feed for the horses. Woo already had
turned out the pack-horses, which were grazing
out of sight of the camp, and the cowbells on two
of them could be heard tinkling in the distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon I drew a prize,” declared Hippy
pompously, referring to Woo.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Time will tell,” answered Emma Dean.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I agree with you,” answered Elfreda Briggs.
“One shouldn’t jump at conclusions, as Grace
Harlowe says.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Saddles were quickly removed, and, before doing
anything else, the men of the party washed
the backs of the ponies to prevent the animals
becoming saddle-sore. By the time they had
finished and turned out the ponies to browse, the
guide had supper ready for them. The air was
hot and motionless, for they were not yet high
enough in the mountains to catch the cool breezes
from the snow-clad tops, and all felt the heat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Chinaman had prepared a supper that won
golden words of praise from the girls of the Overland
party, and Stacy and Hippy ate until it
seemed as if they must pop open. The flapjacks
fairly melted in the mouths of the Riders and the
coffee they pronounced to be delicious.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Won’t it be fine not to have to do any cooking
on this trip?” smiled Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. I feel as if a great load had been lifted
from my shoulders,” agreed Stacy. “I did most
of the cooking for our Pony Rider outfit. Ordinarily
I would rather cook than do most
anything that I know of.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sincerely glad that you are not cooking
for this party,” declared Emma Dean with
emphasis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are congratulating yourselves too early,”
interjected Nora Wingate. “We are all going to
do work just as we always have done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace and Elfreda agreed with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t mean that we’ve got to get up in
the dewy morning and rustle grub for the outfit,
do you?” demanded Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, of course,” answered Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is the fun of camping,” said Miss
Briggs. “We should soon forget all we knew had
we servants to do the work for us. He is an
industrious fellow, though, I must say,” added
Elfreda, glancing at Woo, who was busily at work
washing dishes and singing “Hi-lee, hi-lo!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is a song-bird, too,” observed Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woo, you must be saving of the provisions,”
called Grace. “Remember we must make our
supplies go a long way, for we shall not get any
more for some time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t wolly till to-mollow. Hi-lee, hi-lo;
hi-lee, hi-lo!” sang the guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s that he says?” demanded Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He says, ‘Don’t worry until to-morrow,’”
interpreted Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha, ha!” laughed Chunky, and the Overland
Riders joined in the laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You savvy plenty to-mollow. Me savvy glub
to-mollow,” added Woo, chuckling to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He speaks hog Latin quite fluently, doesn’t
he?” observed Stacy solemnly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You leave it to Smith. I found Smith, you
know,” reminded Hippy Wingate pridefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hi-lee, hi-lo!” sang the Chinaman, continuing
with his work, while the Overlanders, having
finished their supper, gathered about the campfire,
and forgot the heat of the California night in
its cheerful glow. It seemed good to them to be
out in the open once more, to be where they were
obliged to depend almost wholly on their own
resourcefulness for their food and lodging, if not
for their lives, for they were going into perilous
places, places fraught with dangers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woo, having completed his work, and having
hung his frying-pans and other equipment to
nails driven in a tree, sat down on his haunches
by the fire, and, after composing himself, lost his
long yellow fingers in the mysterious depths of his
wide-flowing sleeves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy plenty fine night,” he observed,
gazing blissfully up into the sky. “You savvy
plenty fine night, too?” he asked, looking soulfully
at Miss Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I savvy the same as you do, Woo,” replied
Elfreda soberly. “It is going to be a fine night
for sleep, but I think the air will be cooler
later on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Woo nodded wisely, and Stacy glanced up with
quickened interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are we going to sleep on the ground?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” answered Tom Gray. “You ought to
be used to that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are there snakes up here?” questioned the fat
boy apprehensively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy plenty snake,” the guide informed
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What kind?” wondered Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lattlers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He means rattlers,” interpreted Grace
Harlowe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, wow!” muttered the fat boy. “I think
I’ll climb a tree.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will take pot luck on the ground with the
rest of us,” answered Tom rather severely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy lattler in blanket once,” declared
the guide. “Lattler sleep plenty in blanket.
Go away in molning. Lattler no hurt Chinaman,”
explained Woo.</p>

<p class='c007'>Signs of uneasiness were observable among the
girls of the Overland party, and in Stacy Brown
as well. Tom declared that Woo was “drawing
the long bow,” and said that he never had heard
anything of the sort about the Sierra trails.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have,” announced Hippy. “There are
snakes all about here, but we are not going to
lose any sleep over it. Besides, Stacy is getting
the wiggles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. For goodness sake, drop the subject.
You folks give me the willyjiggs,” shivered Emma
Dean.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m not getting the wiggles,” protested Stacy.
“I reckon I’m not afraid of anything that walks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We were not speaking of that kind,” reminded
Nora. “We were speaking of reptiles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long do you figure that it will take us
to get into the High Country?” asked Grace by
way of changing the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy eight days,” answered Woo. “You
savvy mebby pony him no climb?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, they can, too,” objected Stacy indignantly.
“Our ponies can go where a bird can.
Don’t you forget that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy plenty snake, too,” added Woo.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For goodness sake, stop that snake conversation,”
cried Emma. “I shall surely dream about
snakes if you go on that way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Smith grinned happily, then proceeded, with
the utmost composure, to relate experiences with
big rattlers in the Sierras. He told of waking up
in the morning and finding one coiled in his
blanket, under his arm, or, perhaps, nestled close
to his neck for warmth from the chill night air
of the higher altitudes, until Stacy was on the
verge of a panic, and Emma Dean was shivering.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Smith,” she said, after regarding him inquiringly
for some moments. “Have you ever
had any experience with transmigration of
thought?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tlans—tlans—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Transmigration,” assisted Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tlansmiglation! Les. Me savvy. Me savvy
one time big hunter shoot one in mountains.
Woo savvy bad medicine and run away,”
chuckled the Chinaman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon that will be about all for you this
evening, Emma,” observed Hippy Wingate, amid
peals of laughter from the Overland girls.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom got out the bedding, consisting of a
blanket apiece, and a tarpaulin for a cover, while
Woo busied himself with cutting browse which he
placed on the ground and laid blankets on it. It
was not a particularly soft bed at that. While
they were preparing their beds, Stacy poked about
with a stick, covering a radius of several rods.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What in the world are you doing?” demanded
Nora Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is beating up the landscape to drive out
the serpents,” answered Emma. “You are a
tenderfoot, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t like the fleas to get next to my skin,”
explained the fat boy lamely. “They tell me
that these California fleas are awful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Were I as tough as you, I do not believe I
should worry about a little thing like that,” retorted
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy made no reply, but poked the fire savagely,
then piled on more wood, occupying all the
time he could before preparing for bed, and the
others had turned in long before he was ready.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop that fussing and come to bed!” ordered
Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, for goodness sake, do,” added Miss
Briggs. “Woo Smith, aren’t you ready to turn
in?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Les. Me savvy glub first.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You might fetch Uncle Hip and myself a bite
to eat while you are on the food question,” suggested
Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No food until breakfast,” admonished Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>After idling about and grumbling for fifteen
minutes more, Stacy finally crawled in under
the tarpaulin, uttering dismal groans and complaints
about the hardness of his bed. All were
lying with feet towards the fire. The smoke and
the blaze drove away insects, and the warmth was
pleasant, even though the night was sultry, and
it was not long after that when the Overlanders
dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woo, chuckling to himself and muttering, crept
cautiously to the men’s side of the fire, surveyed
the layout, then crawled in under the tarpaulin
beside Stacy Brown. A few moments later,
Hippy, who lay next to Stacy, was aroused by the
fat boy’s mutterings. Stacy was dreaming about
snakes. Hippy knew because he heard his fat
nephew say, “Snakes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll teach that boy a lesson and make him
dream of something worth while,” decided Hippy.
Rising on one elbow, Lieutenant Wingate glanced
over the row of heads just visible above the top
of the tarpaulin. He could barely make out their
features in the faint light, but when his gaze
finally came to rest on the face of the sleeping
Chinaman, Hippy Wingate was suddenly possessed
of a brilliant idea. Woo lay flat on his
back, both hands snugly tucked into the wide-flowing
sleeves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have it,” chuckled Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reaching over Chunky very cautiously, he
lifted the long black queue of the guide, held it
for a moment, then softly dropped it across the
face of the sleeping, snoring Stacy. Chunky
muttered and stirred restlessly. Hippy waited,
then began slowly drawing the queue over Stacy’s
face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fat boy awakened suddenly, but he did
not move at once, for he was fairly paralyzed with
terror. Something cold and soft was wriggling
over his face. Uttering a mighty yell, Stacy
grabbed that wriggling queue, at the same time
giving it a tug.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was now Woo Smith’s turn to yell, and yell
he did, as he struggled and fought to free himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy, hurling the thing from him, leaped to
his feet, howling lustily. He stepped on Woo and
went over backwards, landing on Hippy’s stomach,
struggling and fighting, and finally finishing
up by fastening his fingers in Tom Gray’s hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The camp was instantly in an uproar, and none
was more loud in his protestations than Hippy
Wingate himself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chX' class='c008'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />“BOOTS AND SADDLES”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Stop that noise!” shouted Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>Emma uttered a frightened cry and
springing up, started to run.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come back! We are all right,” commanded
Miss Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, what is it? Hippy, my darlin’, are you
all right?” wailed Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Snakes! Snakes! Oh, wow!” howled Stacy
Brown.</p>

<p class='c007'>All hands had turned out in a hurry, and Woo
Smith was dancing about chattering and fondling
his head at the base of his queue.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Snakes! Where?” cried Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It crawled right over my face,” declared Stacy.
“I grabbed it and hurled it from me, and think
I must have flung it against a tree and killed it.
Uncle Hip, go see if you can find it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You poor fish!” chortled Hippy Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—you must be a good thrower, for there
isn’t a tree near where you slept,” declared Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s so, there isn’t,” admitted Chunky.
“Well, anyhow, it must have been a stone that
I threw the snake against.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What you did do, young man, was to fall on
me with your full weight,” rebuked Hippy. “Oh,
why did I ever ask you to come with us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what I have been wondering,” agreed
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please, please quiet down, good people,”
begged Grace laughingly. “Suppose we find out
what actually did occur. Does anyone know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. I know. A great big snake crawled
over me,” averred Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With all due respect to you, Stacy Brown, I
don’t believe it,” differed Elfreda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He ate too much and had the nightmare,”
suggested Miss Dean.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It wasn’t a mare. I tell you it was a snake,”
insisted Stacy. “I guess I know what I am talking
about, and don’t you try to make me believe
anything different. I won’t! I know what I
believe, and I believe what I know, and that’s
the end of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, sir, what is the matter with you?” demanded
Tom, facing the excited Chinaman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Smith has the willyjiggs, too,” answered
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woo chattered and caressed his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy somebody pull queue. Me savvy
head almost come off. Ouch!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just a moment. Just a moment,” begged
Grace. “You say someone pulled your queue?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Les.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This demands further investigation,” spoke
up Hippy. “The question now before this tribunal
is, who pulled the Chinaman’s queue.
Emma Dean, did you pull Honorable Smith’s
queue?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not,” retorted, Emma indignantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, all right; don’t get all heated up
about it. I take it that none of the other ladies
tried to scalp our guide. How about you, Stacy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy declared that he didn’t know anything
about it, and cared less, and Tom Gray said the
idea that he had done such a thing was preposterous.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will leave it to Smith,” announced Hippy.
“Woo, did Mr. Brown try to pull your halter
off?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Les, les. Me savvy him pull queue. Him
neally pull head off. Woof!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I begin to understand. Ladies and gentlemen,
the mystery is solved. The Honorable Woo
Smith’s queue got on Stacy’s face and Stacy
thought it was a snake. You see how easy it is
to be carried away by one’s imagination. Stacy,
if you raise further disturbance in this outfit I
shall require you to roost by yourself. I, for one,
at least, need my rest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Woo will get out I’ll keep quiet,” answered
Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t wolly till to-mollow,” advised the
Oriental, pawing about like an animal, in
search of a suitable place on which to lie down
and sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>No further disturbance occurred that night,
though Stacy refused to turn in until he had seen
Woo lie down at some distance from him, and at
daybreak the Overlanders were aroused by the
“Hi-lee, hi-lo!” of the guide, who was out gathering
wood for the breakfast fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, folks. Wash and get busy,” urged
Hippy. “Who is the wrangler this morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is Stacy’s turn, I believe,” replied Tom
Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want to wrangle. I’m too sleepy and
too cold,” protested the boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That makes no difference. There is to be no
shirking in this outfit,” answered Uncle Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wrangler is the man who goes out in the
morning to round up the horses. Following the
custom in the mountains, the Overlanders had
turned out all but two of the ponies, permitting
the stock to graze where it pleased through the
night. The pack animals had been hobbled. It
now became Stacy Brown’s duty to find the animals,
and drive the herd into camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t hear the cow bells. The animals must
have gotten away quite a distance,” suggested
Emma mischievously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy took all the time he could in getting
ready, and, as a result, by the time he was ready
to start, breakfast was nearly ready to be served.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t I eat first?” he questioned anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly not. Wranglers always go out for
the horses before breakfast,” reminded Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chunky threw himself into the saddle and galloped
away at a reckless pace, but his was a long
chase, for the ponies had wandered some distance
from camp. They were lying down in a glade
and did not move or make a sound when the boy
rode past them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy had followed their trail out, but, suddenly
discovering that he had lost it, he turned about
and went back to pick it up. This time he discovered
the animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So! There you are, eh?” he jeered, regarding
the horses resentfully. “Thought you would
play me a smart trick, did you? I’ll be even with
you for that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After much floundering about, the white pack
pony, Kitty, finally got up grunting and groaning
dismally, then Stacy began removing the hobbles
from their legs. Kitty gave him the most trouble,
the white mare insisting on grabbing Chunky by
the trousers every time he stooped to unfasten
the hobbles. This continued until Stacy finally
lost his patience, and, getting a switch, he gave
Kitty a good sharp touching-up. Finally, having
completed his task, he turned their heads towards
camp and mounted his own saddle pony.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shoo! Go on, you lazy louts! Think I am
going to eat cold grub, just out of consideration
for you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was shortly after that that the Overlanders
in camp heard the tinkle of the bells on two of
the pack animals, and when Stacy rode into camp
the party was half way through breakfast. Slipping
from his saddle, Stacy started at a run for
breakfast, flinging a set of hobbles at the cook as
he passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy! You are becoming a very violent
young man,” smiled Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Becoming?” spoke up Emma Dean. “It is
my opinion that he always has been. No one
could acquire his manners in so short a time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Association sometimes plays strange freaks
with one,” retorted Stacy. “Say, Uncle Hip.
That white mare is a terror. She actually hid so
that I should not see her; then, when I finally
found her, she tried to eat me up. The brown
one is the laziest thing I ever saw. We ought to
call her the Idler, she’s so lazy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good!” cried Elfreda. “Idler she shall be,
with the permission of our Captain, Grace Harlowe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How about the other one?” asked Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The black?” questioned Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. He is always stumbling and getting
into difficulties,” said Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will name him Calamity,” said Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is what I was going to name the Chinaman,”
grumbled the fat boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The wrangler always attends to the packing,
you know,” reminded Elfreda after they had
finished breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This wrangler doesn’t,” answered Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course, in view of the fact that this is our
first morning out, and that you are still a little
green—” teased Miss Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“His natural color,” interjected Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will help you,” finished Hippy. “By the
way, you need not throw the diamond hitch
around the packs this morning. Kitty has a soft
pack, and the square hitch will answer very well,
provided you make it good and tight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’ll make it tight, all right. I’ll lash it
so tightly that the old horse won’t be able to
breathe. I owe her a grudge, anyway,” declared
Stacy. “Did you folks know that I learned a
new hitch at Gardner?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Impossible!” exclaimed Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is called ‘The Lone Packer,’” continued
Stacy, unheeding the interruption. “It is even
harder to learn to tie than is the diamond hitch.
For a load of small articles it is supposed to be
the best in use. The particular feature about it
is that it pulls the pack away from the animal’s
sides and prevents chafing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, here! That isn’t the way to throw a
square hitch,” objected Hippy, hurrying over to
Stacy who was laboring with the white mare’s
pack, Kitty standing with all four feet braced,
groaning dismally. “What have you done to
her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I? Nothing. She thinks she’s smart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy regarded the pack animal keenly, then,
stepping up, he placed his hat on top of her pack.
The mare flinched and groaned. It was a test
that Hippy had seen practiced on lazy horses in
France during the war.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So that’s it, eh?” he chuckled. “She is
soldiering, but never mind. We will take all that
out of her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is what I told Kitty this morning. I
promised her that she should get all that was
coming to her. Stand up, you lazy-bones!” commanded
Stacy sharply, at the same time giving
the mare a slap on the stomach. Kitty instantly
retaliated by taking a chunk out of the boy’s
sleeve, and a wee bit of skin with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy howled and jerked away. His face
flushed, and he raised a hand to strike back.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t do that!” rebuked Grace. “Never,
never strike a horse on the head! It is a sure
way to spoil an animal. And never punish a
horse when you are in anger. Should an animal
need punishing, punish him humanely, but trim
him so thoroughly that you never may be called
upon to repeat the performance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, she bit me,” protested Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forget it!” laughed Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should say that the poor beast is already
sufficiently punished after biting Stacy Brown,”
observed Emma meekly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be firm, but gentle,” continued Grace.
“Kitty is in just the right mood to be spoiled by
rough treatment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy was not over-gentle. He jerked the
white mare about, shook his fist in her face and
announced in a loud tone what he would do to
her did she ever again try to make a meal out
of his arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime Hippy, with an interested
group of Overland girls observing, was putting
the final touches to the packing, making the
lead-ropes fast, using a knot that he had learned,
by which, in case of trouble, one can reach from
his saddle and jerk the pack free by a single pull
on a loose end of a rope.</p>

<p class='c007'>All was now ready for the start. Woo Smith,
with a final look backward, started ahead singing
blithely. Hippy whistled “Boots and Saddles.”
The Overland ponies knew the signal, but of
course the pack-horses did not, though they soon
would learn that it was the command to get under
way. When a short distance from camp, the
pack animals straggled off and sought their own
trails near the one that was followed by the riders,
Hippy now and then shouting to Woo to keep
them up, for the Idler was lagging behind, though
she had started out in the lead of the pack-horses.
Woo Smith’s “Hi-lee, hi-lo!” sung in the
Oriental’s shrill, knife-edge voice kept time for
the plodding ponies, that were now climbing up
a steep grade. The Overland party were well
started on their way to the high places of this
wild, rugged country, where genuine adventure
awaited them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXI' class='c008'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />PONIES GET A BAD FRIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Up and up traveled the Overland party,
the ponies here and there being obliged
to zigzag back and forth, picking their
way like mountain goats.</p>

<p class='c007'>The members of the party were keenly interested
in watching the pack-horses to see how they
acted under these trying circumstances, and, to
their satisfaction, found that the animals were
thoroughly familiar with their work. The saddle
horses of the Overlanders, they had seen in action
before, and knew what they could do. Now and
then the white mare would poise with all four feet
bunched as if she were about to make a leap into
space, then slowly one foot would reach out for
a footing. Having found it, the other fore foot
would follow, then the hind feet, Kitty all the
time groaning dismally and wheezing like a leaky
valve on a locomotive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ordinarily, horses on a trail make an effort to
keep within sight of each other, but in this instance
Idler, the brown mare, did not appear to
care whether she were within or out of sight of
her companions. Hippy, when they made the
noon luncheon camp, searched his kit for an article
that he had brought along, thinking it might
prove useful. He did not let the others see what
it was, but secreted it on his person. This article
was a pea-shooter, and he had the peas to use
in it, too.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the party moved on after luncheon,
Hippy dropped behind to better observe the pack-horses.
Idler loafed, as usual. Hippy tried the
pea-shooter on her, and the brown mare jumped
at a critical point. All four feet went out from
under her, and she landed on her back, greatly
to the detriment of her pack, and, had it not been
that the pack was very strong, the outfit she carried
would have been ruined.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, the clumsy beast!” groaned Grace Harlowe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What ails the silly creature?” cried Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has thrown a fit,” Stacy informed her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy, whose scheme had exceeded his expectations,
sprang from his saddle and ran to the
fallen horse, which, by this time, had rolled over
on her side. One foot further and Idler would
have slipped down along the rocks a hundred feet
or more.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy! Sit on her head! Fetch me a rope,
someone,” urged Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Passing the rope about the animal, they threw
it around a tree above the trail, then began removing
the pack, which Tom had loosened by
pulling on the pack-rope. Relieved of the weight
on her back, Idler, aided by a pull on the rope,
struggled to her feet, and, after no little effort,
she was gotten back on the narrow trail. About
a hundred feet above them, perched on a pinnacle
of rock, sat the Honorable Woo Smith, hands lost
in his flowing sleeves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hi-lee, hi-lo! hi-lee, hi-lo!” sang the guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy shied a pebble at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you stop that ‘hi-lee’ business?” he
demanded. “It is lucky for you that you are
above instead of below me, or I’d roll a rock down
on you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let the cook alone!” ordered Tom Gray. “I
don’t understand what caused that beast to lose
her footing so suddenly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy Wingate, however, understood only too
well, but he did not think best to enlighten his
companions, who might have found unpleasant
remarks to make. A full hour was lost in getting
the brown mare and her pack in condition to proceed,
then the journey was resumed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later in the day, Lieutenant Wingate found
occasion to use his pea-shooter again. The first
effort in that direction had proved so successful
that he could not resist the second shining
opportunity that presented itself. This time Stacy
was the victim.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy was asleep in his saddle at the time, his
pony moping along with head close to the
ground, when Hippy sent a pea straight at the
tender flank of the animal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pony woke up suddenly, and then another
pea hit it. The fat boy’s mount bucked beautifully,
and Chunky took a long flight, landing
head-first in a wild rose bush, howling and struggling,
not rightly knowing what had occurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, here! What’s going on?” shouted
Tom, turning in his saddle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy has come a cropper. Oh, please do it
again, Stacy. It was beautiful,” urged Emma
enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I fell off,” wailed the boy, raising a very
red face above the top of the rose bush. “I—I
transmigrated, didn’t I, Emma?” Stacy grinned
sheepishly. “I’ll trim the beast for that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will not,” laughed Hippy. “The pony
was not to blame in the least.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact, the pony appeared to be
even more amazed at the mishap than were the
Overlanders themselves. The excitement ended,
and the party once more under way, Chunky began
to ponder over what had occurred, and the
more he pondered the more convinced did he become
that someone had played a trick on him.
He eyed each member of the party narrowly,
finally regarding Uncle Hip with suspicion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder if he did it?” muttered the boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trail was growing more difficult and perilous
with the moments, and the Riders were
making not more than a mile-and-a-half an hour,
and at one point it curved so sharply that the
riders in the lead, in this instance Tom and Stacy,
were directly above Lieutenant Wingate, traveling
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hulloa! What’s Uncle Hip up to now?”
wondered Stacy, casting suspicious glances at him.
Chunky saw something glisten in the hands of
Uncle Hip; then he saw him place the glistening
object to his lips and blow. Miss Kitty snorted
and jumped, after which she quickened her pace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, that’s the game, is it?” grinned Stacy
Brown. “I reckon I know now what made me
come a cropper into the rose bush. Uncle Hip
used a pea-shooter on my pony. Wait till I get
an opportunity! I’ll make a show of him for
that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom had halted at the summit, and, shading
his eyes, gazed off over the scene before him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you call that hole down there?”
questioned Elfreda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That? That is a box canyon,” replied Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are we going down there?” wondered Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’re going to do a giant leap for life to the
bottom of the box in a few moments,” Stacy
Brown informed her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom removed his sombrero and mopped his
forehead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see nothing that looks like a trail,” he declared.
“Woo, are you positive that there is a
safe way to get down?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Woo bobbed his head vigorously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Him plenty good way. You no savvy tlail?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy tlail. You come. Me show.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind, Woo. We are going to find that
trail for ourselves. This isn’t the first time we
have been in the mountains. You watch us,”
answered Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy crawled down the mountainside for some
distance, working along, first to the right, then
to the left. He observed, at the same time, that
the wall on the opposite side of the canyon had
a more gradual slope. Climbing the other side
would be easier than the one they were now going
down. There was no trace of a trail on the
Overlanders’ side, but Hippy found a way to
get down.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well?” questioned Grace, upon his return.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We can make it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course we can make it. We shall have
to jump, though,” said Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose you jump first, then, if the jumping
is good, perhaps we may follow,” suggested
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jump? Why, you wouldn’t dare jump off
from a silver dollar,” declared Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Produce one and see whether I dare or not,”
offered Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I don’t think I have one,” stammered
Stacy amid laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All ready,” announced Lieutenant Wingate,
mounting and starting down the sharp incline.
The others watched him for a few moments, then
followed, the pack animals taking their places
without being urged, not at all disturbed over the
perilous descent. Hippy was now taking a zig-zag
course, which was the only safe way, unless
one preferred to adopt Stacy’s suggestion and
jump. To look at the mountain, traveling down
its steep side would seem to the novice an impossibility.
However, ponies familiar with
mountain climbing are sure-footed and unafraid,
and do some remarkable climbing, frequently
going where a tenderfoot would hesitate to crawl
on hands and knees.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here and there were small trees, with an occasional
growth of bushes, which afforded more or
less protection from a bad fall, but on other parts
of the trail the rocks sloped away for hundreds
of feet, lying smooth and glaring in the bright
afternoon sunlight. The Overland Riders took
the descent without any display of nervousness,
but Kitty, the pack-horse, groaned and grunted
all the way down. One would imagine that she
was suffering agonies, but it was simply habit
with her, and she got no sympathy, though now
and then she did feel the sting of a pebble that
one or another of the party hurled at her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate was making much more
rapid progress than his companions, he being
eager to reach the bottom before the light failed
them, for it would not do at all to be caught on
the side of the mountain after dark. A shout
from below told them that he had reached the
valley. It was answered by another shout from
above, then a “Hi-lee, hi-lo!” in the high-pitched
voice of the guide. A stone came bumping down
not far from Woo.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy, did you throw that stone?” shouted
Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop it! You might hit someone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to hit someone. I want to wing that
song-bird, and I’ll do it yet,” threatened Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>The safe arrival of the rest of the Overland
party at the bottom of the pit put a stop to
further gaiety at the expense of the guide. They
found themselves in a valley about a quarter of
a mile in width and of unknown length. The
place was a meadow in the heart of the mountains,
carpeted with the brown California grass
that did not appeal to the appetites of the horses,
and as soon as the animals were turned out they
made haste to climb the opposite slope in search
of the succulent greens that they seemed to know
they should find up there.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime, preparations for making
camp and getting supper were going on systematically
down in the canyon. It was an ideal
place for camping, sheltered from storm, and from
sunshine during the early and late hours of the
day. A clear, cold brook rippled merrily on their
side of the canyon, its waters leaping from the
black rocks or lying in sombre bank-shadowed
pools; and, despite the apparent dryness of the
landscape, gorgeous bush-flowers bloomed, filling
the air with their perfume, the valley farther
down being a riot of varied colors where the
stream had left its banks and spread out over the
lower land.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, girls, isn’t this fairyland?” breathed
Elfreda Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wonderful!” agreed Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All but the fairies,” answered Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have a gnome,” suggested Emma, glancing
at Chunky. “Fairies don’t stuff themselves.
They live on atmosphere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This fairy doesn’t live on atmosphere,”
retorted Stacy. “He takes his belt off, if necessary,
too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would suggest that you take it off now and
get to work. We have plenty of it to do,” reminded
Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>All hands turned to, to help the cook, for they
were hungry, and it was natural that they should
be, for climbing mountains in the High Country
is hard, grilling work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Supper was a busy rather than a lively affair,
but after supper the Overlanders found their
tongues and were soon engaged in good-natured
raillery, but they were quite ready to turn in when
Tom Gray whistled “taps.” This time there was
no hesitancy on the part of anyone to sleeping
on the ground, and they dropped off to sleep with
the tinkling of the bells of the pack-horses in their
ears, the rich perfumes of flowers in their nostrils,
their senses lulled pleasantly by the song of the
locusts and strange insects that none remembered
ever to have heard of before.</p>

<p class='c007'>The camp was awake shortly after daybreak.
Once more Stacy Brown had to be urged forth to
wrangle the horses. He protested loudly when
Elfreda pointed to the opposite slope, which
Chunky must climb, for the animals were nowhere
in sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose I might as well go out. I always
get the fag-end of the stick,” grumbled Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind, Chunky. I’ll fetch the horses,”
offered Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no. I just wanted to say something,”
returned Stacy, hastily stirring himself into activity
and jumping on the bare back of his pony.
No sooner was he on than he was off again, for the
pony had never been ridden without a saddle, and
promptly bucked when his owner mounted.
Stacy landed flat on his back in the campfire,
sending up a shower of sparks and smoke, and it
was only the quick action of Nora Wingate
that saved him from being burned. As it
was, his clothing was smoking when he was
dragged out. Hippy and Tom put Stacy’s fire
out by grabbing the boy up and throwing him in
the creek, where Stacy rolled over whooping and
howling his disapproval of the entire proceeding.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You should have known better than to try
to ride that pony without a saddle,” rebuked
Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy turned angrily on his now meek-eyed
pony.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You donkey! Oh, you doddering idiot!” he
raged, shaking a fist at the animal. “You’ll pay
for that! You’ll rue the day and the minute
that you bucked me off your back. Where is
my saddle?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind. I will get the ponies,” grinned
Hippy. “You aren’t fit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am. I’m always fit. I’ll get ’em myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be sure to bring back the donkey,” teased
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy cinched on his saddle before starting,
and this time the little animal offered no protest,
but galloped away as docile as could be desired.
After he had left them, the Overlanders had a
good laugh at his expense, then began packing
in preparation for the day’s journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders finally began to wonder what
had become of Stacy, for he had been absent
much longer than seemed necessary, then, all at
once they heard a yell on the opposite side of
the canyon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There he is! He is in trouble again,” cried
Tom, starting for his own pony.</p>

<p class='c007'>“See him come! He will break his neck,”
worried Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom halted at his pony’s side, for he had discovered
something else. Right on the heels of
Stacy’s mount came the saddle-ponies and the
pack-horses. The latter, being hobbled, were
hopping like kangaroos, making long leaps, covering
a great deal of ground in each leap and turning
their heads to glance back with almost every
jump.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What can be the matter?” wondered Grace,
anxiously watching the descent of the fat boy.
Every second she expected to see him come a
cropper and fall the remaining distance down the
mountainside, but Chunky did nothing of the
sort. He stuck tightly to his saddle, now and
then casting apprehensive glances back at the
horses that were tearing along in his wake.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate, suddenly surmising what
the trouble was about, ran for his rifle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wha—at is it?” stammered Emma Dean.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are stampeding. Something is chasing
them. I think I know what it is,” answered
Hippy, darting across the canyon, clearing rocks
and other obstructions in a series of lively leaps,
the others of his party standing gaping, wondering,
some of them a little fearful, especially for
the safety of the panic-stricken Chunky.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXII' class='c008'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />AMID THE GIANT SEQUOIAS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Stacy swept past, flinging back some unintelligible
words, the ponies still tearing
along after him. The Overland Riders
shouted with laughter at the funny antics of the
hobbled pack-horses. Kitty had forgotten to
groan, and Idler was imbued with a new spirit
of activity.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the moment the outfit had forgotten all
about Lieutenant Wingate. When finally they
thought to look for him he was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hippy! Oh, Hippy!” hailed Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>No answer came back from Hippy, who was
stalking the mysterious something that had
stampeded the ponies.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?” cried the Overlanders in one
voice, as Stacy rode back to them wide-eyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know. It was something big and
awful. I couldn’t see all of it, but it looked to
me like an elephant. Maybe it was a Bengal
tiger, but I didn’t wait to see. If I had waited,
the ponies would have run right over me. When
I saw them coming I threw on the high-speed
lever and lit out for home. I transmigrated.
Where is my rifle? I am going back after that
beast, whatever it may be and—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There goes Hippy across that open space,”
cried Grace, pointing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and he is after something,” added Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look! Oh, look!” cried Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>All eyes were turned in the direction indicated
by Grace. They saw a dark object moving across
the open space towards Hippy, then saw the
lieutenant raise his rifle and fire. Still the object
came on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a bear! Hippy’s missed!” groaned Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll wager my hat that Uncle Hippy didn’t
miss,” answered Stacy. “He never misses—when
he hits.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy raised his rifle and fired again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was a hit!” cried Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy galloped his pony up the other side of
the mountain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Came near making a meal of you, didn’t he,
Uncle Hip?” called Stacy as he came up with
Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tried to shoot him between the eyes, but
he dodged as I pulled the trigger. Next time I
couldn’t do any fine aiming because the bear was
too close. Do you see what he is—a big
cinnamon bear? I am going to have that skin.
Go back and tell them to wait until I finish this
job, and that we are going to have bear steak
for supper to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy galloped back with the message, then
Tom rode out to assist in the skinning and to
select such meat as he wished to carry with them.
The bearskin proved to be very heavy, but Hippy
insisted on taking it along, first, however, treating
the skin so that it would keep until they
reached a place where the curing and tanning
might be continued.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woo, upon observing the bear skin and the
steaks taken from the animal, lapsed into song,
which Stacy pretended not to hear. It irritated
Chunky to listen to that “Hi-lee, hi-lo!” and
put him into a fighting humor.</p>

<p class='c007'>An hour after their delayed start they topped
the rise on the opposite side of the canyon and
paused to gaze over the peaks and rugged mountain-tops
that lay before them in a vast panorama.
Over yonder in the clouds hung the snow-capped
peaks of the High Sierras, now and then taking
on a purple shade from some tinted cloud.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It doesn’t seem possible that we shall be able
to make those mountains with our ponies, does
it?” wondered Elfreda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are we going there?” demanded Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hm-m-m-m!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you getting cold feet already?” teased
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not yet, but I expect to when I get in those
chilly looking snow-caps off yonder,” answered
Stacy quickly. “This life is just one ridge after
another.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They had mounted ridges, and crossed broad
and narrow valleys for some time without incident
and the steady creak of saddle straps and girths
was becoming monotonous, when suddenly
Grace’s pony jumped clear of the ground with all
four feet and began to back. Grace Harlowe,
instantly understanding, called “Look out!” and
whirled her pony about.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the trouble, Grace?” called Tom,
who was riding farther to the rear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A snake! I heard it, but do not know where
it is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stay back. I will find him and dispatch
him,” shouted Hippy, hurrying forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Send him a message for me while you are
about it. Tell him Emma Dean wishes him to
transmigrate,” chortled Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then Lieutenant Wingate discovered the
snake, and raising his rifle he aimed it over the
head of his pony for a few seconds, then pulled
the trigger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you get him?” shouted Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course he did. My Uncle Hip never
misses anything,” declared Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. Not even food,” added Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may all get off. I am going to skin
the reptile. He is a fine specimen,” announced
Lieutenant Wingate. “I propose to make a hat
band of him. It isn’t everyone who can wear
a rattler around his sombrero, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll say that was a fine shot,” declared Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but not better than almost any other
person could make,” differed Emma Dean.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Velly fine. Me savvy fine shot,” interjected
the Chinaman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Emma, in a way, is right,” spoke up Grace.
“It does not take any sort of marksmanship at
all to shoot the head from a rattler. Even a
person who never has fired a gun in his life should
be able to shoot one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t believe it. Suppose you let Emma
try it when next we meet a snake. Point your
rifle at a rattler and he will line his head up with
the muzzle. Move the muzzle from side to side
and he will follow it, always keeping his head in
line with it. Then, all you have to do is pull the
trigger. Why, I believe I could shoot and hit
one with my eyes shut. I think I should like to
make the experiment next time we see a rattler,”
said Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind; never mind! We will take
your word for it,” protested Stacy Brown. “We
do not need a public demonstration.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It surely would be interesting,” agreed Elfreda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, all right. Just let me know when the
show is coming off and I’ll have business on the
other side of the mountain,” declared the fat boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>During this temporary halt the pack-horses
had plodded on alone. They made a detour of
the spot where the snake was being skinned,
seeming instinctively to know where they were
expected to go, and soon after they started off,
Woo Smith followed with his “Hi-lee, hi-lo!”</p>

<p class='c007'>About midday they topped a range of hills, and
before them saw revealed a vast forest that
stretched over more miles of mountain country
than they cared to try to estimate. At first they
had no idea of the bigness of the trees; it was
merely a great forest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate, who had been gazing inquiringly
at the scene, fanning himself with his
sombrero, turned to his companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good people, you are now gazing on some of
the big trees of California of which you no doubt
have heard or read much. Before you lies the
world-famous Sequoia forest. Let us push on.
When you are among the trees you will get a
better idea of their great height.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You should have been a guide on a sightseeing
bus,” averred Emma, as the Overlanders
rode on.</p>

<p class='c007'>The party reached the edge of the great forest
some two hours later, where, in the cool shadows,
they halted for a rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am told,” resumed Hippy pompously, “that
this forest comprises more than five thousand
specimens of trees.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you will also observe,” announced Emma
Dean, standing up in her stirrups and waving
her sombrero, “that many of them are from ten
to twenty feet in diameter. At the great height
to which they grow, the least leaning either way
would cause the trees to break off. You will observe,
also, the perfect symmetry of the trees.
They are perfect works of art,” finished Emma,
resuming her seat on the saddle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hooray!” shouted Stacy Brown. “Emma
has transmigrated again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Emma’s companions looked at her in amazement,
then burst out laughing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where in the world did you learn all that,
darlin’?” questioned Nora Wingate admiringly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I heard the postmaster at Gardner telling
Hippy about it,” answered Emma meekly, amid
shouts of laughter at Lieutenant Wingate’s
expense.</p>

<p class='c007'>The scene was so impressive that the laughter
of the Overland Riders soon died away, for the
great silence of this wonderful forest had taken
strong hold on them. Whereas all other forests
in which they had traveled, were continually nodding
and murmuring, the giant Sequoias stood in
absolute calm. Tom Gray explained this silence
by saying that, owing to their great height, the
trunks were solid, the branches rigid and the
movement very slight. Even though there might
be some slight murmurings, the tops were so far
above the ground that the human ear could not
catch the faint rustling up there.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the party moved on through the silent
forest aisles, the bigness of the trees grew Upon
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You savvy big tlees?” asked Woo Smith
finally, after a long period of silence on his part.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders nodded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know where there is a spring or a
creek?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy spling,” nodded Woo.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lead us to it. Is it far from here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The guide answered with a shake of his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>An hour later, no water being yet in sight,
Grace called a halt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woo, I do not believe you savvy any spring
at all,” she said. “I think we should camp right
where we are. It will soon be dark, and if we
keep on going we shall undoubtedly be worse off
than if we remain where we are. Smith, have
you lost the trail?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woo did not reply at once, but gazed up at the
tops of the trees, muttering to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re lost! That’s what’s the matter,”
grinned Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woo no lost. Tlail him lost. Me savvy tlail
lost,” chuckled the Chinaman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought so,” agreed Hippy gravely. “There
being no objection, I second Grace’s motion that
we camp here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“While you are making camp I will go out
and prospect for water,” offered Tom, wheeling
his pony about and riding off into the forest.
Tom, being a forester by profession, an experienced
woodsman, they felt no concern over his
departure, but, as the hours following his departure
wore on and Tom Gray did not return,
the Overlanders began to worry.</p>

<p class='c007'>At nine o’clock they began firing signals at intervals,
and Woo Smith built up a blazing fire,
but there was no response to either signal. Grace
Harlowe was the least worried of the party.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will have supper,” she said. “Tom will
be all right. Should he be lost it will not be the
first time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but what if he doesn’t find himself?”
questioned Emma tremulously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In that event he will make camp and sleep in
the forest, so you folks make your beds and turn
in for a good night’s sleep, just as I am going to
do,” urged Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hi-lee, hi-lo!” chanted Woo.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop that noise, will you!” commanded
Chunky. “I am not in the mood for song this
evening, and I might do you bodily harm,” he
added, starting to prepare his bed. This he did
by smoothing the ground with an axe swung adz-wise
between his legs, then filling in the open
space with dry pine needles. The Overlanders
observed his work in interested silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do know how to do something, don’t
you?” approved Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Someone in the outfit has to have a head with
him,” retorted Chunky. “It makes me sleepy
to look at it. If I weren’t sleepy I would make
beds in the same way for you girls. Let Uncle
Hip do it, I can’t keep awake long enough.
Good night!” Stacy lay down, and the others
quickly cradled under their blankets and went
to sleep, watched over by the huge Sequoias that
had stood sentinel on that very spot for hundreds
of years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, all at once, it was morning. The songs
of birds filled the air, and a squirrel, whisking
its tail nervously, chattered on a giant tree trunk,
then darted up out of sight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIII' class='c008'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />THE CAMP AT THE “LAZY J”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Stacy sat up and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did you wake me up for?” he
demanded. “Hulloa, Tom!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I awakened you by transmigration of
thought,” answered Emma. “Oh, girls, girls,
wake up! Tom is here,” she cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>The camp was instantly aroused. Tom was
discovered sitting calmly by a little fire that he
had built, waiting for the sleepers to awaken.
Tom had done exactly what Grace said he would.
When he lost his bearings in the darkness, he
lay down to wait for daylight. When daylight
came he found no difficulty in picking up his trail
and returning to camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you find water?” demanded Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a drop. For that reason, we must take
a quick breakfast and hurry on. I think we shall
find water beyond the next low range, and it is
necessary that we do so before the sun gets high
and hot. We can stand it for some time longer,
but the horses cannot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The start was made soon after that, Tom and
Hippy packing their belongings while Woo and
the girls were getting breakfast. The trail they
followed took them up a gradual slope for several
miles and then pitched giddily into a deep canyon,
a canyon that covered all of fifty acres, from
which the hills rose in great swells into the far
distance. The climb down the side of the mountain
was tiresome and difficult, but they forgot
their discomfort when finally they came upon a
stream of cold, sparkling water that came down
from the snow-capped tips of the High Sierras.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, look!” cried Emma. “Cows! Now we
can have some milk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cows!” groaned Stacy. “Those aren’t cows,
they are cattle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There were loud exclamations of wonder when
the Overlanders saw a lot of cattle, in charge of
several herders, grazing less than a mile away.
After permitting the horses to drink all that was
good for them, and after the Overlanders themselves
had drunk and filled their water bottles,
they galloped on towards the herd. From the
herders they learned that the cattle belonged to
the “Lazy J” ranch. The animals were on their
summer grazing grounds, having come up into the
hills for the summer months.</p>

<p class='c007'>The herders informed the Overlanders that the
ranch-house was about five miles due east of
there, and that the boss would be glad to see
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My horse has a loose shoe. Is there a blacksmith
outfit over there?” asked Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure,” answered a herder. “You’ll have to
do your own smithing, though.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon I can do that all right,” answered
Lieutenant Wingate. “We can make camp there
and have a rest before we undertake the next
hard climb.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After waving good-byes to the herders, the
Overland Riders resumed their journey, arriving
at the “Lazy J” ranch about mid-afternoon.
They were warmly welcomed by Mr. Giddings,
the foreman, who showed his amazement that a
party of young women should have made the
rough ride into the mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Help yourselves to anything in sight. It’s all
yours,” he offered. “Glad to have you take pot
luck with me in my shack. There isn’t much,
but what there is you are welcome to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. You sit down with us and have a
snack,” urged Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Giddings did so, and after a late luncheon
he conducted Hippy to the blacksmith shop,
where Lieutenant Wingate removed the loose
shoe from his pony and straightening it on the
anvil proceeded to nail it back in place, observed
interestedly by the Overlanders and several
cowboys who were resting up at the ranch-house.
Even the cowboys’ cook came out, frying-pan in
hand, to see how the tenderfoot would go about
it to shoe a horse.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cowboys looked on with solemn visages,
expressive of neither approval nor disapproval.
Their interest quickened, however, when Stacy
Brown announced that he was going to remove a
loose shoe from the off hind foot of the white
mare, Kitty, and set it properly in place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kitty was led in, and Chunky made his preparations
with sundry flourishes to show the spectators
that he knew what he was about. Kitty
was not unobservant, and every move of the
Overland boy was narrowly watched by her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should advise you to watch her ears,” urged
Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It isn’t her ears, it’s those hind feet that I am
interested in,” replied Stacy. “Ears can’t hurt
a fellow—feet can,” he said. “Whoa, you
brute!” added Stacy, running a hand down one
of the pony’s hind legs, then lifting the foot from
the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>What followed was almost too swift for the
human eye. Barely had the foot been lifted than
Kitty kicked the boy clear out of the shop. In
his flight, Chunky was catapulted against the
cook, and both went down in a heap.</p>

<p class='c007'>The faces of the cow-punchers relaxed. They
howled, fired their revolvers into the air and went
fairly wild with joy, while Grace and Elfreda disentangled
Stacy and the cowboys’ cook and stood
them on their feet.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic003'>
<img src='images/img2.jpg' alt='' class='ig003' />
<p>“Are You Hurt?”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Are you hurt?” begged Grace solicitously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course I am. I’m killed, but the white
mare is going to get worse than I did,” threatened
the fat boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cool off. Don’t punish her now,” advised
Elfreda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want to cool off. I want to shoe that
beast.” Stacy strode belligerently to the now
meek little animal. “I ought to break your
miserable neck, but I haven’t time to do it to-day.
Besides, the weather is too warm. If I did, this
outfit would make me dig a hole and bury you.
I always get the worst of it when trying to do a
good turn for others. Now you stand still or I’ll
surely forget myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This time Kitty made no objection to having
her loose shoe removed, but once off Stacy did not
know how to put it on again, and Tom Gray had
to finish the job to the great enjoyment of the
cowboys. The job finally finished, Stacy and
Hippy perspiring from their efforts, the Overlanders
went out to watch the range men come
in, uttering wild whoops as they discovered that
there were women in camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Throwing themselves from their saddles, the
range men soused their heads in the creek that
flowed near the ranch-house, and were ready for
the evening meal. After supper, all hands
lounged out to the green in front of the bunkhouse,
smoked their pipes and told thrilling stories
of adventure in the Sierras—told them for the
benefit of the tenderfeet who were their guests.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overland girls chatted with the rough but
big-hearted cow punchers, who, that night, declared
that they never had come up with such a
likely bunch of young women.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Mr. Giddings learned from Tom Gray
that the party was bound for the High Sierras,
he shook his head dubiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No place for white folk, especially women,”
he warned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not?” questioned Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Trouble! It’s the Devil’s country up there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are used to roughing it under all sorts of
conditions,” replied Tom. “We learned how to
do that during the Great War. All these young
women were in the service, at or near the front
in France; Mr. Wingate was an aviator, and I
was a Captain of Engineers, so you see we aren’t
afraid of trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s all right. I take off my hat to you,
especially to the young ladies. This country is
another breed of cats, however, and they tell
strange stories about men going up there and
never being found afterwards, or, as is sometimes
the case, found dead in the Crazy Lake section.
Aerial Lake, they call it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is this mysterious lake?” asked Miss
Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t rightly know. I don’t know anything
about it. I reckon I don’t want to know.
Neither would you if you had been up here long
and had heard as much about it as I have. Did
you ever hear of the Jones gang?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon we have. We had a little mix-up
with them. At least, we understand that was
the outfit,” Hippy informed them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and we drove them off and gave them a
good walloping,” added Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s hear the yarn,” called a cowboy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy related the story of the hold-up and of
the skirmish that followed, resulting in the driving
off of the train robbers. The cowboys listened
attentively, their expressions showing an increasing
respect for the “tenderfeet” who had dropped
in on them for a friendly call.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why should this band of outlaws have reason
to interfere with us?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do they bother other folks?” answered
Mr. Giddings. “For what they can get out of
it, of course,” he said, answering his own question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They will not get much if they hold us up,”
Grace Harlowe informed their hosts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. I reckon that would not likely put you
in peril, for the reason that they are after bigger
game, like that treasure on the Red Limited.
There’s another thing, though, that might make
it equally bad for you people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is that, Mr. Giddings?” asked Elfreda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The railroad has had Pinkerton detectives
after that gang for a long time, on account of an
express robbery, which makes the gang rather
touchy about strangers being in the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where does this Jones crowd make its headquarters?”
questioned Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s just the point. Nobody seems to
know, but they are supposed to hang out to the
eastward of this place. We have never seen any
of them since I have been on this range, which
is going on five years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then we do not have to bother our heads
about them at all,” announced Tom. “We are
not going in that direction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re going to the peak, aren’t you?” asked
Giddings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” replied Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hm-m-m-m-m! I’ll bet I know what you
folks are after. You’re after golden trout.
You’re not the first parties to come up here looking
for those shiny fellows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eh? What’s that?” questioned Hippy, instantly
on the alert.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are they? I’m the boy that is looking
for gold,” spoke up Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe there ain’t any such thing,” laughed
Giddings. “But they do tell a story about a
prospector coming across a stream up Farewell
Gap way, where the golden trout were as thick
as pollywogs in a mud puddle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom said he had never heard of them. Giddings
replied that he reckoned no one else ever
had in reality.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They do say,” resumed the foreman, “that
when the fisherman discovered those fellows
basking in the sun at the bottom of the stream,
he sure thought he had struck it rich. He believed
that he had found sure-enough gold nuggets,
but when he went to gather them, the
nuggets just up and dusted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s the way nuggets usually do,” answered
Stacy wisely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope we find them,” said Hippy. “I have
a rod and a book of flies with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s enough to give a fellow heart disease,
anyway,” continued Giddings. “So, between the
Joneses, the lake and the movable nuggets, you
folks have plenty of entertainment ahead of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is generally excitement and some
trouble where we hang up our hats,” laughed Nora
Wingate, “but we manage somehow to get along
all right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish you luck, pardner,” nodded Mr. Giddings.
“I’ll have a bunk-house cleaned out for
you folks to-night, so you can sleep indoors,” he
offered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thanking him, but declaring that they preferred
to sleep in the open, just as they had been
doing for several seasons, the Overlanders made
camp out of doors just beyond the corral. The
night was hot and the flies very thick. The
night’s rest was not at all satisfying for this
reason, and for the added one that the cowpunchers’
ponies in the corral were restless.
Hippy said it indicated that a storm was coming,
but Stacy differed with him. He averred that
the ponies were restless for the same reason that
he was—because the flies bit them—and the
Overlanders laughingly agreed that there might
be something in the fat boy’s reasoning after all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next morning they were out with the earliest
of the punchers. After breakfast, packs were
made up and lashed with firm hitches thrown
about them. Then bidding good-bye to their
hosts and shaking hands all around, the Overland
Riders set out for their long journey over the
mountains—a journey that would occupy some
weeks and be filled with exciting as well as
enjoyable experiences.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIV' class='c008'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />WOO’S EYES ARE KEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The air was becoming chilly, the Overland
Riders now being at an altitude
of nearly eight thousand feet, and still
upward bound.</p>

<p class='c007'>A week had elapsed since they left the
“Lazy J” ranch, and during all that time they
had sighted no game except some grouse that
they had shot at but failed to bring down. Provisions
were at a low ebb and all knew that they
were nearly face to face with a serious situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy Wingate was pondering deeply when
they pulled up for luncheon one noon. He was
wondering what he was going to give his party
for supper, for Hippy was the official game-hunter
of the Overland party, and they had come to
rely on his resourcefulness to provide food for
them. Stacy Brown was even more deeply interested
in this matter than was “Uncle Hip,”
but for a somewhat different reason.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do we eat to-day?” he asked in a tone
that he tried to make sound light-hearted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some one laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, it’s not because I’m hungry,” hastily explained
Chunky. “I just wanted to know so as
not to have to open all the packs unless we are
going to have a spread.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ours is more likely to be a snack than a
spread,” suggested Grace laughingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it going to be, Hippy?” questioned
Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Raisins and hard tack, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t mean it?” gasped the fat boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon that will be about it if I don’t see
some game to shoot at,” replied Hippy a little
soberly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Raisins and hard tack for a man with an
appetite like mine,” groaned Stacy. “You might
as well feed a bricklayer on angel food and expect
him to smack his lips and pat his stomach with
heavenly satisfaction. This is too much, and too
much is enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you folks will camp here I will go out and
see if I cannot scare up some game,” suggested
Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not believe you will find anything worth
while at this altitude,” said Tom Gray. “It is a
condition that I have feared we should meet.
I—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You no savvy game?” interjected the Chinaman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Smith,” replied Hippy. “We savvy
plenty appetite, but we no savvy anything with
which to satisfy it. If I could sight a deer—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy deer. Me show buck in lelet,”
cried Woo, gesticulating excitedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What kind of heathen talk is that?” wondered
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Buck in lelet!’” mocked Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy was eyeing the guide inquiringly, knowing
very well that Woo had something in mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Buck in lelet,” repeated the Chinaman, indicating
the horns on a deer’s head, with his
hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I understand,” nodded Tom Gray. “What
he is trying to say is, ‘buck in velvet.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha, ha! The further they go the worse they
are. First it was Emma Dean whose wheels went
wrong; now it is my Uncle Hip and Captain
Gray,” jeered Stacy. “Is it the altitude that has
gone to <i>your</i> head?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, it has not,” retorted Lieutenant Wingate.
“Woo has more sense than all of us together.
At this season of the year the bucks ‘carry their
antlers in velvet.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, pooh! That is a fine fairy tale to feed
hungry people with. Folks back east might
swallow it, but not up here among the high and
lofty peaks of the Sierras. Tell me something
that I can swallow,” laughed Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy, if you will hold your horses I will try
to explain,” rebuked Tom. “At this season of
the year the antlers of the bucks are very tender,
and that condition is called ‘carrying the antlers
in velvet.’ In those circumstances the bucks frequent
the high rocky peaks that their tender
horns may not be torn off in contact with tough
bushes and trees. Later on you will find the
bucks on the lower ranges. Then, as the antlers
become hard, almost as hard as iron, the bucks
take to the dense thickets.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy Brown mopped his forehead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Emma, why don’t you transmigrate a little?
Send a little thought wave out and see if you
can’t get in touch with a nice fat buck all dressed
up in velvet,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c007'>Emma Dean elevated her nose, but made no
reply. She was at that moment more interested
in the guide, who was running his yellow fingers
about his wrists inside the wide sleeves, and
chuckling to himself at a rapid-fire rate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy! Hi-lee, hi-lo; hi—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What were you going to say?” urged Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You savvy buck in lelet?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy buck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do? Where?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The guide pointed his long, bony finger towards
the rocks on the other side of a narrow pass in
the mountains. The mountain there was covered
with brownish grass and some spindling saplings.
Lieutenant Wingate looked until his eyes ached,
then turned to Smith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woo, you must be mistaken,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>The guide took the stick that he used to beat
up the trail ahead on his march each day, laid
it across a rock, and, after sighting it, beckoned
to Lieutenant Wingate to look over it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You savvy?” he questioned eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I don’t, Woo.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mebby you savvy to-mollow,” replied the
Chinaman disgustedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overland Riders snickered, and even Hippy
grinned appreciatively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon you are not far from right, Woo.
I—” Hippy paused abruptly. Out of that mass
of brown something began to grow into his vision,
to stand out until everything else appeared to
have disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You savvy nicee piecee buck?” chuckled the
guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy reached a cautious hand behind him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My rifle. Quick!” he whispered. “Woo is
right. There lays a fine big fellow behind that
bush over yonder. I don’t know whether he sees
us or not. It is a dead sure shot, too. Don’t
make a sound,” urged lieutenant Wingate as his
rifle was cautiously laid in his outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Placing it across the rock where Woo had laid
the stick for him to sight over, Hippy took careful
aim a little below the base of the antlers of
the buck. His automatic rifle belched forth a
deafening roar that went rolling and echoing from
peak to peak.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same instant, what appeared to be a
dull brown and white ball leaped into the air
and went bounding away in tremendous leaps.
Hippy’s rifle went to his shoulder and he fired
again, but the shot only served to hasten the
speed of the fine large buck that Woo Smith had
discovered. Hippy had missed a “sure shot” as
well as a long shot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle Hip never misses what he shoots at,”
quoted Emma a little maliciously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you use your pea-shooter?”
scoffed Stacy. “Dead Shot Hip made a mess of
it that time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He did,” admitted Hippy, “and Stacy Brown
missed a fine fat meal. Laugh at me all you like,
folks. I deserve it, but I don’t understand how
I could miss that shot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t wolly till to-mollow,” advised the guide
wisely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“May I look at your rifle?” asked Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate handed it to her and Grace
gave it a critical inspection, then held it out to
Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look it over carefully. I think you will discover
why you missed,” she suggested.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy intuitively glanced at the sights, and
shot a quick look of inquiry at Chunky, but
Chunky’s face was woodeny in its lack of expression.
Without another word, Lieutenant Wingate
set up a mark, placed his rifle on the rock, marking
its exact position, and, taking careful aim,
fired. The bullet shot under by more than a foot,
whereas it should have shot over the mark, the
rifle being originally sighted for a much longer
distance. Several cartridges were expended in
resighting the weapon and adjusting the open
sight, which he found had been changed from its
former position.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, now! Show me another deer. I don’t
believe I shall miss the next one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You savvy sight no good,” chuckled the
Chinaman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate nodded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy, come here. I would hold converse with
thee,” he ordered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy complied, but with evident reluctance,
and, obeying a gesture from Hippy, seated himself
on a slab of granite beside his Uncle Hip.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did you fool with the sights on my
rifle?” demanded Lieutenant Wingate sharply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I—I—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t quibble. Whenever you put on a
wooden face I know that you have been up to
monkey-shines. Why did you do it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I—I just wanted to get even with you,
Uncle Hip,” stammered the fat boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—you pinked my pony with a peashooter
and made me come a cropper in a rose
bush. Don’t you deny it. You know you did,”
added Chunky, adopting his most savage tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy Wingate chuckled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is it, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When did you change them—change the
open sights?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did it when you were after water last night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shake, pard!” cried Hippy, extending an impulsive
hand. “We are quits now, aren’t we?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, we are dear friends. We’re more than
that—we love each other most to death,” declared
Stacy fervently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, fiddlesticks!” exclaimed Emma Dean.
“You make me weary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Stacy, the next time you wish to get
even with a fellow, please do not tamper with
his weapons, especially in a country like this,”
warned Lieutenant Wingate. “It is a dangerous
thing to do. Suppose I had met up with a cinnamon
bear at close range, for instance—what do
you think would have happened?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon there would have been a sprinting
match between you and the cinnamon,” observed
Stacy in a tone that brought a shout of laughter
from the Overland girls.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are partly right,” agreed Hippy laughingly,
“but don’t do anything like that again,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy promised that he would not, but the
probabilities are that he forgot the promise
within five minutes after he had made it, for at
that instant Woo Smith uttered a sudden exclamation
that drew the instant attention of the
Overland Riders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy buck! Me savvy buck in lelet,”
chuckled the Chinaman excitedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy was on his feet in an instant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where, where?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You savvy him white lock?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I see the white rock. Sure enough;
there he is!”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the automatic roared a moment later, a
brown ball was seen to leap into the air, but,
instead of bounding away, it straightened out and
took a long, curving leap, crashed into the dwarfed
bushes, then whipped over on its back.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I got him!” shouted Lieutenant Wingate
triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great shot!” cried Elfreda Briggs enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hi-lee, hi-lo; hi-lee, hi-lo!” sang the guide,
hopping about delightedly, his queue wriggling in
the air with serpent-like movements. This time
no one appeared to be irritated by Woo’s singing,
for Lieutenant Wingate’s shot meant food in
plenty for the Overland Riders.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXV' class='c008'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />FOLLOWING THE AERIAL TRAIL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Shouting and laughing, the entire party
raced down the hill and up the other side
to view the result of Lieutenant Wingate’s
shot. They found the buck lying dead where it
had fallen, with a bullet hole through its head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can my Uncle Hip shoot? Well, I reckon he
can,” declared Stacy pompously. “Cleverness
runs in our family,” boasted Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That quality must have exhausted itself before
you joined the family,” retorted Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy admitted that he had lost some of it
after becoming a member of the Overland Riders,
which, he said, was undoubtedly due to association
with inferior intellects, to which Emma had
no reply to make, other than characteristically
elevating her nose and turning her back on the
fat boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, come,” urged Hippy. “Stacy, you and
Tom will have to help me dress this beast if
you want meat. It is certain that we shall not
starve today.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The job of dressing the buck was accomplished
clumsily, the Overland girls being interested
spectators and offering frequent suggestions on
the subject, of which they knew nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>That night the Riders enjoyed a great spread.
Following it, such of the meat as they wished to
carry with them they spitted on sharp sticks in
the smoke of the camp-fire. This was the beginning
of the curing process required to put the
meat in condition to keep, so that they might
carry it along, for the party did not dare trust
to the chance of finding other game farther on,
fearing that they again might be caught foodless.
One experience of the kind was enough.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate and his companions had
learned a lesson in observation from the guide,
and Hippy began to understand that a hunter,
when after game, must put out of his mind every
object in the landscape except the particular
thing for which he is looking. He tried out
that idea that same day by looking for various
objects, one at a time, and was amazed at the
result. Under this method, objects that he had
not before observed at all now stood out with
great prominence. Hippy then recalled what an
old hunter, then sniping Germans, had told him
in France: “Let your eyes sweep quickly over
the landscape but pay no attention to the more
prominent objects, and you will be amazed at
the quickness with which you will discover that
for which you are looking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The method worked out just as Hippy’s informant
had said it would, and Hippy determined
never again to be caught napping. However, his
respect for the guide had increased considerably,
and especially for the keenness of Woo Smith’s
eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>With all the venison they could carry packed
in their kits, the party set out early on the following
morning and soon found themselves on
the brink of another box-canyon, which they
reached without mishap, then made their way up
the side of another mountain, and on over a
series of rugged elevations that would tax the
sure-footedness of a mountain goat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This up and down progress reminds me of
a wild ride that I once had on a scenic railway
at Coney Island,” declared Elfreda Briggs as they
finally halted for a rest. Elfreda’s face was red
from exertion and excitement, and her hair had
become the plaything of the mountain breezes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t wolly till to-mollow,” chuckled Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy, you’re right,” nodded Tom Gray.
“But it is now time we were moving. See that
ridge to the right of us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surely we do not have to cross that, do we?”
begged Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. We shall have to ride its entire length
in order to reach the high mountain peak that
you see still farther on. Either we must start
now or wait until tomorrow,” averred Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It never will do to be caught on the top of
that ridge in the darkness,” agreed Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ridge referred to lay slightly higher than
their present position, but there was plainly a
safe trail leading to it. Orders to move were
given by Hippy. The Overland Riders were
quickly in their saddles, and the party slowly
mounted the ridge, but halted as they came to the
top of it. For once the girls experienced a case
of “nerves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We never shall be able to ride over this
awful trail,” cried Elfreda Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, let’s go back,” begged Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Impossible!” answered Hippy. “This is the
trail that we shall have to follow to reach the
high peak of the Sierras.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the horses behave and no one loses her
head we ought to be able to cross safely,” averred
Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My head is swimming already,” moaned Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you turn it over and let it float
for a few minutes?” suggested Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>After directing Woo to proceed on ahead, the
journey was resumed, and the ponies stepped out
over the knife-edge top of the ridge. This ridge,
not more than a dozen feet wide along the top,
formed a natural bridge connecting two mountain
ranges. Here and there the sides of the ridge
fell away sheer for hundreds of feet, and at others,
smooth granite rocks sloped away to the canyon
below.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ahead of the Riders, Woo Smith was picking
his way unconcernedly, singing blithely. The
girls of the party sought to look equally unconcerned,
but not with very much success, for each
one was feeling the effect of the great height and
their peril on the narrow path. Emma Dean
finally slipped from her saddle, and passing the
bridle-rein over one arm, proceeded to pick her
way on foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cold feet, eh?” scoffed Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. I’m scared, that’s all,” replied Emma.
“I don’t care who knows it, either.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace glanced at the faces of her companions,
and then, at the rapidly narrowing trail.</p>

<p class='c007'>“While I believe that we shall be in less peril
on our ponies than on foot, I suggest that we all
walk,” she said, dismounting. “With your feet
on the ground you will be less nervous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace’s companions lost no time in following
her example, but they dismounted cautiously. It
was a relief to feel the solid ground under their
feet. A laugh further relieved the strain when
Hippy Wingate finally dismounted. The girls
teased him unmercifully, though all knew that a
man who had fought the Germans in the clouds
was not likely to be disturbed by great heights. A
few moments later Stacy dismounted, but Tom
remained on his pony and appeared to be enjoying
the novel experience of riding along this
unusual aerial trail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Kitty, the lazy pack-horse, as usual,
brought up the rear of the line and was dragging
farther and farther behind. Her actions were observed
with keen interest by the Overlanders,
there being no certainty as to what the white
pack mare might or might not do. She proved
the wisdom of their lack of confidence in her
when, weaving from side to side to avoid stepping
over projecting rocks or boulders, she stepped off
the trail with one hind foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quick, Hippy!” cried Nora excitedly. “She
will fall over!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate sprang forward and gave
the mare a quick slap on her flank. The mare
jumped, then down she fell on her side with hindquarters
hanging partly over the brink, and there
she lay groaning dismally, the picture of misery
and fear. The faces of the Overland girls paled,
for each knew that the slightest struggle on the
part of the white mare would send her sliding
to the bottom of the canyon fully a thousand
feet below.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVI' class='c008'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />GOING TO BED IN THE CLOUDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Hippy, you have done it this
time!” cried Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep quiet! Don’t frighten her!”
cried Grace, snatching the lariat from her saddle
and handing it to Hippy. “Slip the loop over one
of her hind legs, but for goodness sake do not
make any sudden moves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait! I’ll get a derrick,” shouted Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep quiet!” commanded Tom sternly, at
the same time taking a rope from the pommel
of his own saddle and hurrying to Lieutenant
Wingate’s assistance. While Grace, was patting
the head of the fallen animal, trying to soothe
her, Tom slipped the rope over her neck, Hippy
having dropped the loop over one hind foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Tom, you surely will choke Kitty to
death if you pull on the neck rope,” warned
Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Serve her right if I did,” growled Tom. “She
is a perpetual nuisance. What next, Lieutenant?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must haul her up, that’s all. Keep your
rope taut, but don’t put too much strength on
it,” directed Hippy, as he began to pull on the
rope about the white mare’s hind leg. He failed
to budge her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is the pack,” said Elfreda. “Don’t you
see that Kitty’s pack is pressing right against
the rocks?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right,” agreed Tom Gray. “We must
unload the beast before we can do a thing with
her. Confound her!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, Tom,” admonished Grace Harlowe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy! Get that pack off and be careful
about it too,” ordered Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy could not manage the pack alone, so
Grace and Elfreda assisted him in removing it.
This undertaking, perilous as it was, was accomplished
after more than two hours had been lost
through Kitty’s clumsiness. It was then discovered
that the white mare had gone lame, but
Hippy found that she had suffered nothing more
serious than a bruised hip.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must be on our way,” he urged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As it is, we shall not get across this ridge
before dark,” declared Elfreda, glancing at the
lowering sun.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t say that,” begged Nora. “We
must.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Gray shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To make haste would be dangerous,” he
warned.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the white mare was again in proper
shape the party started ahead, determined to get
as far on their way as possible before night, but
darkness was settling over the canyons on either
side of them when Lieutenant Wingate finally
called a halt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must make camp while we can see to do
so,” he directed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, here?” cried Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is the best we have,” answered Lieutenant
Wingate in a doubtful tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trail had been steadily narrowing as they
proceeded, and ahead of them it appeared to be
almost impassable, at least for horses. It was
decided to stake the ponies down in single file,
which the three men finally succeeded in doing to
their satisfaction. It was not an ideal tethering
place, but most of the animals were used to
sleeping in ticklish places, and, in fact, if necessary
could sleep standing up.</p>

<p class='c007'>Packs were removed and stored in safe places,
but Woo, who had been sent out to locate a
spring, returned with the information that he
could find none. This, however, did not disturb
the Overlanders, for their bottles held sufficient
water for supper and breakfast, provided they
were economical in its use, so a small cook-fire
was built, and in a few moments the kettle was
singing merrily and the odors of coffee and venison
were in the air, to the accompaniment of
Woo Smith’s “Hi-lee, hi-lo.” It was an unusual
supper for the Overland Riders, sitting there with
their food served on an army blanket laid on the
ground, with empty space and sombre canyons
on either side of them now filled with inky blackness.</p>

<p class='c007'>While they were eating, Woo gathered stems
of bushes and piled them ready for making a
larger fire to light up the camp after supper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should like to know where we are going
to sleep,” reminded Nora as they finished the
meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom said he would make up their beds very
shortly, whereat the Overlanders laughed, but
with not much mirth in their voices.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you don’t make haste you won’t be able
to find beds to make up,” averred Emma. “Don’t
you see the fog rolling in? We shall soon be
enveloped in it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fog!” Hippy laughed heartily. “Why,
child, that isn’t fog—it is clouds. We are above
them, but I think they will rise and take us in.
When it gets a little darker here, you will see
a sight that will interest you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy’s prediction was fulfilled. The moon
rose full at about nine o’clock that evening, and
exclamations of wonder were uttered by the girls
of the party, as its beams lighted up the slowly
moving clouds that now had risen almost level
with the top of the ridge itself. Here and there
sharp peaks thrust themselves through the cloud
seas, which were dark and menacing to the eyes
of the observers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How beautiful,” murmured Elfreda Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is indeed,” breathed Grace. “The scene
reminds me of the one that we looked down upon
when we were riding the Old Apache Trail, except
that this is infinitely more beautiful. Hippy,
does not this remind you of France, when you
were flying above the clouds?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a way, yes. Many is the time that I have
gone to sleep on a cloud for a few seconds. Tom,
what is our altitude here?” he asked, turning to
his companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“According to my aneroid, about eight thousand
feet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are surely getting up in the world,”
chuckled Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t congratulate yourself too soon, Miss
Dean. We may be going the other way before
morning,” reminded Stacy Brown. “What about
starting a conflagration, Captain Gray?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woo, stir up the campfire and let’s have
some light and warmth,” directed Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, it is too bad to destroy this wonderful
view. If you build a fire we shan’t be able to see
the full cloud effect,” protested Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will,” answered Hippy. “We soon shall
be enveloped in clouds, and we are going to feel
the cold, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a biting chill in the air already and,
to the amazement of the campers, mosquitoes
were numerous and very active.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom, after a survey of their surroundings, said
he would make up the beds, and called to Woo
to bring the pick-axe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Make up the beds with a pick?” exclaimed
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. By the way, where do we sleep tonight?”
asked Miss Briggs in a slightly worried
tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will show you,” replied Tom, beginning to
dig a trench in the thin layer of soil that covered
the ridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you can transmigrate a real bed, I wish
you would make it two so that I may have one,”
called Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom made no reply, but, after digging the
trench, he had the guide and Hippy place stones
on either side of it as an added protection against
rolling out of bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy, get in here and see if this hole fits
your ample proportions,” directed Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy hesitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t like to be buried so soon after supper,”
he complained. “Is this some new game that
you are trying to play on me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. It is a game to keep you from falling
out of bed and making a mess of yourself,” replied
Tom tersely.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVII' class='c008'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />IN THE LAND OF PINK SNOWS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I—I think I should prefer to sleep
downstairs,” stammered Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If that is the way you feel, you have
only to roll over and you will be downstairs for
keeps,” promised Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, I’ll sleep in the hole in the ground,
but don’t you dare throw dirt on me,” warned
Stacy, crawling into the trench and cautiously
disposing of himself to see if his bed fitted.
“This isn’t even half a bed, Tom. How am I
going to turn over?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t,” laughed Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, please do,” urged Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wow!” muttered Chunky sitting up and
peering over the edge of his bed at the cloud-sea
rolling slowly along just below the camp.
“Wouldn’t it be a terrible catastrophe if I were
to be transmigrated out of bed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That depends upon the point of view,” suggested
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders were startled at this juncture
by a shout from the Chinaman, accompanied by
a series of bangs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Somebody knocked over the kitchen table!”
cried Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy piecee kettle go ’way,” wailed Woo,
who, in emptying out some dishes, had let them
fall over the side of the ridge so that the utensils
were then on their way to the bottom of the
canyon, a thousand feet below.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has lost the kettle,” groaned Nora. “At
this rate we shall soon be without anything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Except our appetites,” finished Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a tragedy,” observed Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t wolly till to-mollow,” advised the guide.
“Hi-lee, hi-lo!” Nothing could disturb the
equanimity of Woo Smith for very long, and he
immediately resumed his duties. The loss of a few
utensils was not a thing to be greatly disturbed
about—at least he so reasoned the matter out.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was late in the evening when the Overlanders
finally got into their trenches and dropped
off to sleep, but their sleep was brief. First,
Stacy had a nightmare and set up such a howling
that all hands awakened in alarm. The next
disturbance came when a sudden mountain wind-storm
sprang up. The Overlanders were aroused
just in time to see their campfire lifted into the
air and hurled out over the clouds in which the
embers and sparks quickly disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, this is terrible! We shall surely be
blown off the ridge,” cried Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lie down in your trenches and let the blooming
storm blow itself out!” shouted Hippy. “No
wind-storm up here can harm you so long as you
keep down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girls of the party rather reluctantly lay
down again, and found that, in that position, the
wind barely touched them, and, from that time
on, peace reigned in the Overland camp until
morning. The morning, however, brought with
it fresh troubles. Every member of the party
awakened shivering. Stacy declared that his feet
were frozen, which Emma asserted was a chronic
condition with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders dragged themselves from the
trenches, shoulders hunched forward, hands thrust
into their pockets, their faces blue and pinched.
The limit of their endurance was reached, however,
when the familiar voice of Woo Smith
assailed their ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hi-lee, hi-lo! Don’t wolly till to-mollow,”
sang the guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Smith!” shouted Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He—he thi—thi—thinks he’s a bird,” chattered
Stacy. “I hope he tries to fly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Smith, please cut out the singing and prepare
hot coffee as quickly as possible,” directed
Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy coffee. Me savvy nicee piecee day.
You savvy nicee day?” bubbled the guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, let him have his way, Tom,” urged Grace
laughingly. “We should be glad that we have
such a cheerful guide.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cheerful idiot!” muttered Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Woo. We savvy,” called Grace, smiling
over at the grinning face of the Chinaman.
“Please make haste with the breakfast, though.
Girls, get up and look out over the wonderful
scene before you, and I will guarantee that you
will instantly forget your troubles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With shaded eyes, they looked and did, for the
moment, forget their chilled condition. The
peaks were now in the full glare of the morning
sun, while down in the canyons day had not yet
fully dawned, and the dim shadows there were
gray with the morning mist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another day of hard riding was before them,
but before starting out Tom and Hippy announced
that they would try to find a trail up the mountain
that loomed in the sky some distance beyond.
Upon reaching the end of the ridge that
formed a natural bridge connecting two mountain
ranges, Tom and Hippy came upon a sharp descent
that led down into a broad, open valley, beyond
which lay the mountain they were to climb.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This looks promising,” nodded Tom, as they
jogged down into the valley.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is more than that; it is wonderful,” cried
Hippy as the two men found themselves in a
field knee-deep with blue lupines that grew there
in profusion. The odor of the flowers was almost
overpowering. To the right and the left of the
two explorers were bunches of tuft-grass, here
and there groves of slender lodge-poles, and spindling
pines and junipers. Tom and Hippy
paused in admiring silence. It was more beautiful
than anything that they had thought possible
in this rugged country.</p>

<p class='c007'>While they were hunting for a possible trail
that would lead them up the mountain, Tom
Gray declared that Nature had used this sweetly
scented field for a dumping ground, after having
completed the building of the mountain itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and she protected her work mighty well
when she erected that snow-capped peak,”
answered Hippy. “I know that there <i>must</i> be
a way out of this place to reach that mountain,”
he added, getting up from a fall, very red of face,
his jaw set stubbornly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Despite their persistent efforts to find a trail out
of the valley of the lupines, it was noon before
they did discover a possible way out for their
party. After marking it by tying a handkerchief
to the bent-over top of a spindling pine, they
started back to join their companions. The
Overland party had some time since saddled and
bridled their ponies and were ready to move when
Tom and Hippy returned to them, and all were
on their way soon after the arrival of the two
men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are going to see something that will
gladden your heart, Brown Eyes,” declared Hippy
as they started on. It was late in the afternoon
when they finally rode into the valley below.
The blue lupines, the grass, the pines and the
junipers there presented a scene that brought
cries of delighted amazement from the Overland
girls.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, look at the pink ice cream!” cried Emma,
pointing to the towering mountain which they
were to try to climb.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, Tom, we didn’t notice that coloring on
the snow up there this morning,” exclaimed Lieutenant
Wingate. “It must be a cloud reflection.”
Tom Gray nodded and said that the pink shade
probably would soon disappear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must camp in the midst of these flowers,”
cried Grace Harlowe. “It is finer than any place
we have yet seen in these mountains.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I agree with you,” answered Elfreda. “It
gives me fresh courage to go on. Why, Grace,
I feel as if I could vault a six-foot fence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose you try to jump over the white
mare,” suggested Grace, laughingly. “This high
altitude has gone to my head, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, thank you. I think that it might be
best for a person of my years to keep her feet on
the ground,” laughed Elfreda. “But the effect,
as well as the view here, is wonderful. I do not
believe there is anything like it anywhere else in
the world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Camp was promptly made amid the flowers.
Soon thereafter the clouds on the horizon rolled
down behind the mountains as the sun sank out
of sight, but as long as light remained on the
mountain tops, the wonderful pink tint clung to
the everlasting snows on the pinnacles, and the
mosquitoes increased in numbers and ferociousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The higher we go the worse they get,” complained
Stacy Brown. “Isn’t it queer how that
pink tint hangs on?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, girls,” bubbled Emma Dean, “what if it
should prove to be ice cream in reality?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In that event I know someone who never
would go home,” laughed Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two someones,” reflected Stacy, with a far-away,
longing look in his eyes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXVIII' class='c008'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />AT THE “TOP OF THE WORLD”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The morning dawned with the sky a
molten green and gold. The mountain
peak and the high ridges were a beautiful
pink, and below them lay the green and blue
of the meadow like a velvet carpet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wonderful!” breathed the girls in chorus.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Could anything be more beautiful?” murmured
Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is worth all the hardships we have endured,”
declared Elfreda.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders continued to admire the scene
until breakfast was ready. Immediately after the
meal the journey was resumed, each one eager
to reach the pink snows above that held so great
a fascination for all. They came to the snow line
late in the day. The ponies were left in charge
of Woo Smith to remain until the party returned
from the high peak of the Sierras, which was now
their immediate objective.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that they were close to it, they discovered
that the snow really was pink. No one
seemed able to explain this mystery until Tom
announced it as his opinion that the pink shade
was due to a tiny bright red flower whose petals
were found imbedded in the snow. Stacy
scooped up a handful of snow and tasted it, and
then made a wry face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It tastes like turpentine,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overland Riders danced and capered about
in the snow like school children, and tried to
snowball each other, but found the snow so
crumbly that it could not be rolled into balls.
This they overcame by wetting handfuls of snow
from their canteens, and then, ere they even
thought of making camp, they had a merry snowballing
battle thousands of feet above sea level.
They battled until their breaths gave out in the
rarefied air—threw snowballs at each other until
almost exhausted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind. Don’t wolly till to-mollow,”
comforted Stacy Brown.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the coming of night a chill settled over
the mountain, beside which the previous nights
were almost sultry, and a damp, gray cloud hid
the lower reaches of the peaks like a great gray
blanket. The Overlanders were glad that they
were above rather than below that cloud, and
they hugged their cook fire, though it was far
from being a roaring one, for they did not have
fuel to waste.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Gray, who, before the evening was far advanced,
went out to examine the strange twisted
little trees that grew here and there, discovered
that they were full of pitch. He said nothing
to his companions, but, moving back a little distance
from the camp, he tested one with a match.
The trunk of the twisted tree flared instantly.
He put out the blaze with snow and returned
to camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How would you folks like a real camp-fire?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There ain’t no such thing,” mocked Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace gazed at her husband inquiringly, knowing
quite well that Tom had some plan for a fire
in mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The easiest thing in the world, my dear
friends,” chuckled Tom. “All that is needed to
make a regular conflagration is the know-how.”
Tom struck a match against the trunk of a small
scrubby tree against which he was standing, and
held the match close to the trunk until he felt
the heat, then sprang away from it. The tree
blazed up gloriously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did it with my magic wand!” he cried, waving
his arms dramatically.</p>

<p class='c007'>Exclamations of wonder greeted the achievement,
and the Overlanders gathered about the
blaze, holding out their hands to catch some of
the warmth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy nicee piecee fire,” observed Chunky
solemnly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“However did you do it, Tom?” wondered
Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The tree is filled with pitch,” answered Tom
Gray. “When we get ready to turn in we will
light another one. I don’t suppose we shall get
any warmth from it, but we can hear it crackle,
which will be some comfort.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That night the Overlanders made their beds
under an overhanging rock where there was no
snow, and were lulled to sleep by another of Tom
Gray’s burning trees. They awakened in the
morning again stiff with cold, but half an hour
after sunrise they had fully recovered their
spirits and were making preparations for the long
hard hike ahead of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each of the men carried a pack on his back,
leaving the girls to carry such provisions as they
thought would be needed. Even the rifles had
been left behind with Woo, the mountain climbers
carrying no arms but their revolvers.
Ropes, an axe and a shovel were included in the
equipment and they finally set out for what Elfreda
Briggs characterized as “The Top of the
World.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The peak of the great mountain was reached
late in the afternoon, with all hands well tired
out. They found the summit of the peak strewn
with huge granite slabs, from some of which the
snow had been blown away in spots, forming
little scooped-out cups in the pink mantle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, now that we have enjoyed this punk
view, suppose we get down to some place where
we can make camp and sleep,” suggested Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is where we are to sleep to-night,”
answered Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! Here?” gasped Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Did we not come up here for that purpose?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy shivered, and glanced down over the
glittering snow field, then shivered some more,
but made no further comment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This will be the first time that I ever slept
in a snow bank, and I trust it may be the last,”
observed Emma resignedly. “Last night we
found a nice dry spot for our beds, but up here—Br-r-r-r!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will be as comfortable as though you
were in your own bed at home,” promised Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish to goodness I had your imagination,”
grumbled Chunky. “It must be beautiful to be
able to dream things the way you do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No fuel for a fire had been brought along on
this last leg of the climb above timber line, so
supper was a cold meal. Everyone felt so miserable
after supper that the Overlanders with one
accord began preparing to roll up in their
blankets for the night. Hippy had already dug
trenches in the snow for the party to sleep in,
so they might be out of the wind. The girls
talked chatteringly of everything they could think
of, to assist them in forgetting their misery, then
crawled into their trenches and tightly rolled
themselves up in their blankets.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is the first time I ever went to bed with
my boots on,” complained Elfreda. “Should I
live until morning I surely shall have something
to brag about.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, girls, this is an ideal summer resort,”
laughingly chided Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The response was a chorus of dismal groans.
For a few moments after that the Overlanders
lay gazing up at the bright stars, then a gradual
warmth overspread their shivering bodies, and
one by one they dropped off to sleep, now nearly
thirteen thousand feet above sea level.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXIX' class='c008'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />BOWLING IN NATURE’S ALLEY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Contrary to expectations the Overland
Riders slept soundly all through the
night, but the moment they crawled from
under their blankets in the morning, they began
to shiver.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on! Take a run with me,” urged Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please go away and let me die,” moaned
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must have exercise to start our blood
circulating,” reminded Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want exercise. I want something to
warm me up on the inside,” protested Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace and Elfreda, holding hands, were already
dancing about in grotesque fashion, taking long
draughts of air into their lungs, the color rising
to their faces as the circulation of their blood
responded to their lively movements.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind, folks,” comforted Hippy. “If
you will all take a lively sprint, then a snow-wash,
I will give you something that will please
you and fix you up in great shape.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be past all human help long before
that,” answered Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you transmigrate yourself to a
warmer clime for an hour or so?” suggested Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Gray nodded to Hippy, whereupon Lieutenant
Wingate took from his pack a tiny alcohol
stove, which he filled from a small bottle and
lighted. Over the stove he placed a coffee pot
full of white snow dug from underneath the crust
where it was not tainted with what Stacy had
been pleased to characterize as a “turpentine
taste.” As the snow melted in the coffee pot,
more snow was added until there was sufficient
for their use. The Overlanders, quickly discovering
that something unusual was going on, ran to
the coffee-maker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wha—at’s this?” demanded Elfreda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“An alcohol stove—a hot cup of coffee for
each in a few moments,” chuckled Lieutenant
Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hippy Wingate, did you have that last
night?” demanded Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you let us suffer with cold and eat a
coffeeless supper?” rebuked Nora Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You lived through it. Why kick, now that
you are about to have a warm drink?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We ought to throw you off the mountain,”
declared Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t do it till he gets the coffee ready,”
urged Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The reason that I did not use the alcohol kit
last night was that I had only enough alcohol to
burn the stove for one meal,” explained Hippy.
“I knew that you would be in more urgent need
of coffee in the morning than you were last night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I withdraw my suggestion that we throw you
over,” laughed Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you ready?” called Lieutenant Wingate.
“The coffee is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are we ready? Just watch us,” cried Emma
Dean.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each had an individual cup, and Hippy passed
lumps of sugar to them from his own kit. They
had no milk, but there was no complaint, for the
Overlanders were glad enough to get the coffee
black. This, with some biscuit and cold venison,
comprised the meal, but they declared unanimously
that they had never had a more appetizing
breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have decided,” announced Stacy finally,
“not to be a party to the plan to throw Uncle
Hip overboard—at least not to-day. Good-morning,
Sun! Welcome to our happy home,”
he added, bowing to the rising sun.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom called attention to two birds circling over
them, which he said were jays looking for crumbs,
whereupon the girls broke up pieces of hard tack
and sprinkled them over the ground a few yards
from the camp. The jays swooped down on the
crumbs, chattering and scolding. Grace then
suggested that, having reached the “top of the
world,” they resume their journey and explore
the lower ridges, taking the whole day for their
return to camp. The first quarter of a mile down
was a slide rather than a walk, but the Overlanders
made merry over their frequent mishaps,
finally reaching a long granite slope on the south
side of the mountain where there was little snow.
There, the sun’s rays blazed down all day long,
and there many sparkling streams had their
origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>About them the ground was strewn with
boulders from the size of a man’s head up to great
spheres of flint-like stone, many as round and
glistening as though they had been turned and
polished by man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, look at the beautiful lake!” cried Nora
enthusiastically, pointing to a body of water in
the valley far below them. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It doesn’t appear on my map. I don’t know
what it is,” answered Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps it is the Aerial Lake that we have
been warned against,” suggested Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was thinking of that myself,” nodded Tom.
“There are trees growing in the lake, but what
are those glistening objects farther out?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rocks,” replied Grace, after focusing her
binoculars on the shining marks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder if I can hit one of them,” said Stacy,
picking up a round stone which he sent rolling
down the smooth granite slope. The stone shot
over a broad, shelving rock, leaped far out into
the air, then, after what seemed an interminable
time, splashed into the lake. The Overlanders
saw a tiny spurt of water as the stone struck the
surface of the lake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Folks, I’ve got an idea. Greatest thing you
ever heard of, too,” cried Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Throw it over the cliff,” suggested Emma.
“The very best possible use to which you can put
your ideas.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is exactly what I am going to do, my
dear Emma. Just watch my smoke.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overland Riders were puzzled to know
what Hippy had in mind. First, he cut several
tough lodge poles, then selecting a boulder half
as high as himself, Hippy easily pried it from its
resting place with a pole and started it down the
slope. The boulder soon began to roll, gaining
momentum with the seconds, striking fire as now
and then it came into contact with sharp projections
of rock.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boulder finally hit the shelving slabs of
granite at the edge of the cliff with a mighty
crash and leaped out into the air. The party
watched its projectile-like flight with fascinated
gaze.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then came the splash into the lake. The
Overlanders did not hear the splash but they saw
the water spurt up into the air like a miniature
geyser, and fall in a silver shower over a wide
area.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hurrah!” shouted Stacy, tossing his hat into
the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Gray was excited, and so were his companions.
Stacy Brown was already prying at a
boulder with a pole, while Hippy had run to another
one and was digging an opening into which
to insert his lever, using a flat stone for a fulcrum.
Many of the boulders lay resting on the slope
and thus were easily thrown out of balance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait!” cried Elfreda. “We will have a
game of bowling.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and the highest one that was ever
played,” exclaimed Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I’ll be Rip Van Winkle. Show me a
soft place to lie down and sleep,” cried Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are the ninepins?” demanded Emma.
“One cannot bowl without having something to
bowl at.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Use the trees down yonder in the lake,” suggested
Hippy. “The one who makes the first
score will be free of camp duties for the next
twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I won’t play,” declared Chunky. “I know
you want to work some sharp game on me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the one who makes no score at all must
do the work for all those who do make scores,”
added Elfreda laughingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fat boy sat down stubbornly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go on with your game,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter? Don’t you want to play,
Honey?” asked Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. I’m going to be the umpire,” answered
Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As you please,” laughed Hippy. “You will
have to do the chores anyway. Folks, I am going
to try to hit the third tree to the left of that group
of rocks near the middle of the lake. Now watch
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy started a rock, which he had selected
with great care. It boomed over the ledge, observed
in breathless silence by the spectators,
then hurtled far out over the lake, finally smashing
into the blue waters, throwing spray high in
the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A miss!” shouted the Overlanders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He missed it by half a mile,” jeered the umpire.
“Why don’t you change your sights? You
are shooting over the mark.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic004'>
<img src='images/img3.jpg' alt='' class='ig004' />
<p>“It’s a Hit!”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Tom took the next try. He balanced his rock,
after having pried it loose, and made it ready for
the fall, and sent it crashing along on its way.
As nearly as the eye could measure, Tom’s boulder
fell some twenty rods to the right of the tree
aimed at. Tom then made ready a boulder for
Grace. She failed to hit the lake, and derisive
howls greeted her effort. Elfreda and Nora did
a little better than that. Both hit the lake, but
nowhere near the mark they had aimed at.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy got up slowly and yawned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You folks make me tired. You ought to go
to night school and learn how to roll stones.
Why, even our little transmigrating Emma could
beat you sharps at throwing stones. Emma, will
you roll if I fix a boulder for you?” questioned
Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, if you promise not to play tricks on me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy winked at Emma and nodded sideways
to the others, as indicating that the trick was to
be played on them, then snatching up his pole
he ran to a boulder that he had some time since
selected for his own.</p>

<p class='c007'>After prying the rock into proper position,
squinting and sighting and surveying the rock
from all sides, he nodded to Emma and offered
the pole to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take it easy. If you can’t move the rock
I’ll lend you a hand,” whispered Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ladies and gentlemen, you are now about to
witness one of Emma Dean’s most notable transmigration
feats. Keep your eyes on the
performer and you will see that she has nothing up
her sleeve—nor under her hat,” announced
Hippy Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tip it over!” commanded Stacy, throwing his
weight on the pole with Emma. “Watch the
two twin-trees down there, but look sharply or
you won’t see them when they disappear from the
face of the earth,” he warned, strolling back
towards his companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Emma’s boulder, not being quite round, moved
very slowly at first, and once it threatened to stop
altogether and go no further, but finally, gaining
new impetus, it started savagely on its way to
the ledge, where it did a clumsy hop into the
air, then dived for the lake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is going to hit the lake!” cried Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did you think we were trying to hit?”
demanded Stacy. “If it is a hit—if little
Emma makes a killing, I did it. If she misses,
she did it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a hit!” yelled Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t say?” wondered Stacy, turning
quickly, the most amazed member of the Overland
party.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cheers greeted the achievement as two trees
standing side by side in the lake disappeared as
if by magic. Stacy threw out his chest and
paraded back and forth with folded arms, an
expression of dignified superiority on his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t have to work for a whole week,” observed
Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes you do,” answered Elfreda. “You
know you weren’t in the game—you are only
the umpire. Further, Emma won the roll, and
will have a vacation until to-morrow afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There goes my Hippy’s roll!” cried Nora, and
for the moment attention was centered on Lieutenant
Wingate’s rolling boulder. It made a
clean hit, knocking down a tree close to the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The racket must be terrific down there,” said
Grace. “Hippy, you surely raised a disturbance
with that last shot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom tried once more and sent a boulder into
the lake. The Overlanders plainly heard the impact,
and could see a shower of broken rock being
distributed over the surface of the lake.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly a new sound smote the ears of the
Overland Riders, a familiar sound that they had
heard many times in France and on their journeys
in their own land.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s that?” demanded Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That?” answered Hippy. “Why, that is a
butterfly lullaby. You surely ought to know
that sound by this time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Woo, woo, woo!</i>” was the sound that smote
their ears again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Down, all of you! We’re under fire!”
shouted Tom Gray.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXX' class='c008'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />LEAD AND MYSTERY IN THE AIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Are—are we attacked?” wailed Emma
Dean.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bullets are coming from somewhere,
that is certain,” answered Hippy, raising his head
from the ground on which he, as well as his companions,
had thrown themselves at the first shot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Following the last two shots, the reports of
rifles were distinctly heard by each member of
the party, and each pair of eyes was straining to
locate the source of the shooting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, it must be a mistake,” cried Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That doesn’t help us any,” replied Tom Gray.
“But I do wish we had our rifles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t wolly till to-mollow,” advised Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy raised himself to a sitting position and
waved his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Woo, woo, woo!—Bang!</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy threw himself over backwards, his feet
kicking up into the air, his attitude being so
funny that the Overlanders laughed heartily.
Their laughter, however, quickly subsided, when
they recalled that the last shot had passed very
close to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Gray had been listening to the whistle of
the bullets and to the reports that followed, and
the result of his listening and looking was the
conclusion that the shooters were getting the
range, and that, undoubtedly, smokeless powder
was being used.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t care whether they see me or not,” exclaimed
Hippy, getting to his feet, but no sooner
had he done so than a bullet whistled so close to
him that, as he declared later, he felt the hot
breath of it on his cheek.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you see that?” he cried, throwing himself
on the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. I didn’t see it. I may have sharp eyes,
but they aren’t sharp enough to see a bullet on
the wing,” retorted Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What I cannot understand is, why they are
shooting at us,” wondered Elfreda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps they think we have been throwing
stones at them,” suggested Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rolling stones gather no moss,” interjected
Stacy. “Possibly, however, our rolling stones
came near gathering in some parties down in the
valley, and they are retaliating by shooting at us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Girls! Let’s get out of here,” cried Grace,
springing up. “I am weary of hiding.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get down!” shouted several voices.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace gave no heed to the command, nor to the
bullet that sang over her head, but when one
barely grazed her cheek, she decided that she was
quite ready to join her companions on the ground
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are we going to lie here all day and let those
ruffians shoot at us?” demanded Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The only other alternative is to crawl away,”
answered Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Crawl where?” questioned Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To that ridge to the right of us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m blest if I do!” retorted Hippy, getting
up and walking deliberately towards the rocks
indicated by Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>The others, with the exception of Stacy Brown,
not to be outdone in courage by Lieutenant Wingate,
got up and followed him, not hurriedly, but
walking slowly, keeping some distance between
them, and in this way finally reaching the ridge
and safety. Several shots were fired at them on
the way, but all went wide of the mark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is Stacy? Quick! Maybe he has
been hit,” urged Nora almost hysterically.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace sprang back and peered around the corner
of the rocks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, girls! Look at him, will you?” she
cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaning as far out from the rocks as they
dared, the Overlanders discovered the missing
Chunky. He was flat on the ground on his
stomach, wriggling along in a fair imitation of a
serpent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get up and walk, you tenderfoot!” laughed
Hippy. “What are you afraid of?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing. I just happened to think how,
when I was a baby, I used to creep to the pantry
to pick up crumbs, so I thought I’d see if I had
forgotten how,” answered Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a fine hero, aren’t you?” observed
Emma sarcastically, when Stacy, having finally
reached the protection of the rocks, got up and
brushed the dirt from his clothes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. All the heroes are dead. I don’t want
to be a hero. What’s the news from the front?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Impossible!” muttered Tom, laughing in
spite of himself. Tom had been pondering, wondering,
trying to account satisfactorily to himself
for this attempt on their lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you make of it?” asked Elfreda,
nodding at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It may have been accidental,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace shook her head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, they were shooting at us,” declared
Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been wondering, thinking about what
Mr. Giddings told us at the ‘Lazy J’ ranch,”
said Miss Briggs. “You remember what he said
about the mysterious Aerial Lake, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is my opinion that we have been bombarding
that very same lake,” declared Grace. “That,
however, does not explain the shots.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps not,” returned Elfreda, “but it does
go a long way towards proving that there is
something in what the foreman of the ‘Lazy J’
told us. I, for one, am in favor of giving that
lake a wide berth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no,” protested Hippy and Grace. “Let’s
find out what the mystery is,” added Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll stay back and watch the horses while you
are gone,” offered Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Back to camp for us, now. To-morrow we
shall decide what is best to be done,” advised
Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having reached the safe side of the mountain,
the party took a direct course for their camp,
which was located close to what they had named
“Bear Mountain,” because its top strongly resembled
an ambling bear. They found pretty
rough going until they reached a point about a
mile from the camp, and there Tom suggested
that they move more cautiously, and not blunder
into camp, not knowing what they might find
there.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had approached within sight of their
camp when Hippy halted and beckoned his companions
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?” questioned Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>For answer, Hippy pointed to a jutting rock
which they knew lay just back of the camp itself.
There, outlined on the rock, was a figure. It did
not require very keen eyes to recognize the
figure, even at that distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woo! Thank goodness,” exclaimed Miss
Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll give him a yell,” volunteered Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no!” protested Grace. There was that
in the attitude of the Chinaman that appealed to
Grace’s bump of caution. “Wait until he sees
us,” she counseled. “Trust Woo to shout, unless
there be good reason why he should not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The party moved on cautiously, thus far well
screened by foliage, but the instant they appeared
in the open, the guide saw them and began excitedly
waving his arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you see?” nodded Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He does seem to be excited about something,”
agreed Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If there is likely to be trouble, perhaps I had
better fall back as sort of reserve,” suggested
Stacy. “In case of trouble it is a wise plan to
have reserves, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No one paid the slightest attention to Stacy’s
suggestion, nor did they increase their pace, not
wishing to show that they shared the excitement
of the guide, though there was a suspicion in
their minds as to the cause of that excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they drew nearer, Woo Smith clambered
down from his perch and trotted out to meet
them. His face expressed neither pleasure nor
alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-afternoon, Mr. Smith,” greeted Emma
with dignity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are the ponies all safe?” smiled Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Him velly good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then what are you stewing about?” blurted
out Stacy Brown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anything wrong, Smith?” asked Tom Gray
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Les. Bang, bang!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You mean bing, bing, don’t you?” cut in
Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy bang, bang!” returned the guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, let it go at that,” urged Hippy. “It
doesn’t make much difference either way, whether
it is ‘bang, bang’ or ‘bing, bing’!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy boom, boom, too,” added Woo.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no. You mean bang, bang!” insisted
Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For goodness sake, give the poor fellow a
chance,” begged Elfreda laughingly. “You will
get him so befuddled that he will not know what
he means. Woo, what <i>is</i> the trouble? Have
you seen strangers about?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The guide’s queue bobbed vigorously, as he
pointed to a ridge on the other side of the canyon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy man there. Me savvy boom,
boom! Bang, bang!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace’s face lighted up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We understand, Woo. You heard guns and
you saw a man over there,” she nodded. “Did
the man see you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Chinaman shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think he discovered the camp?”
asked Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woo shook his head again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He heard the boom of our bowling game and
the shots following. That seems quite clear, but
there appears to be no reason why we should be
excited about it,” said Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace said she did not agree with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What the guide says, indicates to me that
the stranger was not only seeking to wing us, but
that he was looking for our camp. Was that all
you saw, Woo?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. Me savvy woman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s that?” demanded Hippy sharply.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders’ interest was aroused anew.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy woman. Woman come close and
peek. Woman see camp, then go ’way. Br-r-r!
Big piecee woman make ugly face!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Discovered!” exclaimed Hippy Wingate
dramatically.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXI' class='c008'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />THE FACE IN THE WATERS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“A woman!” breathed Miss Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must be mistaken,” differed
Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did she look like?” questioned Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy no good,” answered Woo with an
emphasis that drew a laugh from the Overland
Riders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How strange,” murmured Emma. “What
could a woman be doing in this awful country?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps she lives here,” suggested Elfreda.
“I should not be surprised at anything in the
High Sierras.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Show me where she was when you saw her,”
requested Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woo led him to a huge boulder, about a hundred
yards from the camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy piecee woman peek ovel locks,”
said the guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A woman peeked over the rocks there. Is
that it?” asked Elfreda, the entire party having
followed Woo out to the scene of his discovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Les.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did she do then?” persisted Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Him go ’way plenty quick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace and Hippy hurried forward and began
examining the ground, but found no trace, no
footprints, nothing that would indicate that a
person had been there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woo, it is my opinion that you went to sleep
and had nightmare,” declared Hippy laughingly.
“No one has been here. See! She would have
left footprints at least.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Piecee woman go ’way,” insisted Woo.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t wolly till to-mollow,” imitated Stacy
Brown. “Woo, got anything loose about the
house? I’ve been living on pink snow for so long
that I feel like a snowbird in distress. Food is
what my system demands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A bird, did you say?” questioned Emma.
“I agree with you that you are something of a
bird, but not of the snowbird species.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace was the only one of the party who believed
that their guide really had seen a human
being spying on the camp. The others, after
some discussion, dismissed the matter from mind,
and devoted their attention to the supper which
Woo had prepared and served. A much more
comfortable night was spent in this lower altitude,
and, with the rising of the sun, the Overlanders
prepared to resume their journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>The party was still at a considerable elevation
above the lake, which had sunk out of sight as
if it had never existed, due to the fact that huge
granite shelves intervened between them and the
mysterious water. They judged that the lake
must lie at an elevation of close to eight
thousand feet above sea level.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I smell something,” exclaimed Hippy as they
were dismounting for luncheon and a rest that
day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So do I,” agreed Stacy Brown. “Someone
is baking bread and using salt yeast. Lead me to
it, quick!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What you smell is a dead campfire,” Tom
Gray informed the fat boy. “Unless I am greatly
mistaken, the fire has not been out long, either.
Come on, folks, help me to find it. It may give
us some information that we need.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By proceeding against the gentle breeze that
was blowing they were enabled, after considerable
searching about, to locate the dead campfire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here it is!” cried Tom, scraping aside a cover
of leaves and grass that had been spread over the
ashes to hide the tell-tale evidence. “See! The
embers have been kicked aside and water poured
over them. It is the water poured on the fire
that produces the strong odor that we smell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long ago was that done, do you think?”
asked Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Several hours ago, I should say.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy made a circuit of the camp site that
they had come upon, and returning, announced
that he had made a further discovery—the spot
at which horses had been turned loose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There appears to have been four of them,
though I cannot be positive about that,” he said.
“I merely saw the footprints of four animals as
they started on their way northward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But suppose they are looking for us?” exclaimed
Miss Briggs. “If they are headed north
they are headed towards the place where we were
fired upon, are they not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t worry,” laughed Hippy. “They
have a nice, long, rough journey ahead of them.
We seem to have missed each other very cleverly.
However, they may be nothing more than an
exploring party, and we have been so stirred up
over what we have heard of the High Country
that every little thing takes on an importance
that doesn’t belong to it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish I could make a long speech like that
and get away with it,” observed Stacy admiringly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Young man, you say altogether too much as
it is,” retorted Tom Gray. “I think that perhaps
it might be well for us to take an inventory of
our surroundings, as well as of what lies immediately
ahead of us, before we start out,” he
added.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy volunteered to do a little scouting, and
Grace said she would accompany him, as anything
of that sort appealed to her, so they set out
together, but soon separated and took different
courses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace first of all sought a high point from
which she obtained a very good view of the surrounding
country, but saw nothing of a disturbing
nature. A deer stood outlined on a shelf of rock
a few hundred feet above and to the south of
her; a bear ambled across an open space, zigzagging
his way down. Bears do not like to go
straight down a hill or mountain-side. The fact
that their front legs are shorter than the hind legs
makes going straight down a steep incline difficult,
so, unless pursued, they ordinarily follow
the switchback principle, zigzagging along until
they reach the bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overland girl watched the ambling beast
with interest until it finally disappeared. She
had no doubt that it was descending to the valley
in search of food, lured there, perhaps, by the
scent of an abandoned camp. Except for these
two animals, she was unable to discover any sign
of life, nor was there a wisp of smoke within her
vision that might indicate the presence of human
beings.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Grace was making a general observation
of the landscape, Lieutenant Wingate was
endeavoring to follow the trail of the unknown
horsemen to determine, as definitely as possible,
the direction that they had taken. Their trail,
which he followed for nearly a mile, still continued
towards the peak, and it was his belief
that that was their destination, or at least some
other near-by point where they might hope to
meet up with the Overland party.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy pondered over this, and found himself
wondering what the motive of the horsemen
might be. Still pondering, he began retracing his
steps to meet Grace at a point decided upon
before they started away on separate trails.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate was cautiously making his
way through a thick growth of bushes, watching
his step and listening for the familiar whirring
warning of a rattler, when a sudden interruption
occurred, an interruption that caused Hippy to
throw himself on the ground, and lie still.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interruption was a bullet, a bullet that
clipped his hat, nipping a piece out of the brim,
and giving the Overlander a scare. At first he
thought the shot might have been fired by one
of his own party, and was about to call out a
warning, but changed his mind and began wriggling
away from the scene. He had, by this time,
forgotten all about the snake peril, his one burning
desire being to get as far away from that
locality as possible in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy found it slow going, because he twisted
and turned so much, following as crooked a trail
as he could lay out for himself, for the purpose
of confusing the author of that shot, should the
fellow decide to follow him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly Hippy thought of Grace. She, too,
might be in peril. His first inclination was to
get up and run to their rendezvous, but upon
second thought he came to the conclusion that
it would be wiser to make an effort to discover
the one who had shot at him. With this in view,
Lieutenant Wingate began making a detour with
the intention of coming up behind the shooter,
Hippy having a good general idea of the position
occupied by the man at the time the shot was
fired.</p>

<p class='c007'>All his efforts came to naught. He had spent
nearly an hour in stalking his man before he
realized that he was wasting time.</p>

<p class='c007'>While he was engaged in his quest Grace had
sat listening. She had heard the shot, and
reasoned that it had been fired from somewhere
in Hippy’s direction. There being no answering
shot, however, she forced herself to believe that
her companion had shot at a snake, and decided
to proceed on to the place where they were to
meet before returning to camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace took a different route to reach the spot,
and this route took her near a swiftly moving
stream of water that flowed down into the lake.
The stream was wide where she came upon it,
and to find a suitable fording place the Overland
girl continued on further up-stream. Her way
led her under an overhang of granite rocks several
feet higher than her head. Beneath her was a
pool, deeper than the stream below, and in the
pool she saw fish darting. The pool seemed to
be fairly alive with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace’s mind instantly turned to what the
foreman of the “Lazy J” ranch had said about
the golden trout in the High Sierras.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, wouldn’t it be wonderful if I had discovered
a pool of those live nuggets!” she cried,
throwing herself down and gazing into the pool,
on which the sunlight shone, mirroring her own
face and the rocks behind her on its surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They aren’t golden trout at all; they are
mountain trout, and oh, what beauties! I must
tell Hippy and have him get a mess for us. I
reckon that golden trout story is a myth. However,
golden or speckled beauties, it is all the same
to the Overlanders. A mess of fish is what they
need. I—”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overland girl paused suddenly. The smile
on the face she saw in the water faded and a
catch interrupted her breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wha—at is it?” she gasped.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the water, beside her own, another face was
reflected. It was the face of a woman. At first,
Grace believed that some trick of nature was
showing her a double of her own face, distorted
and unrecognizable, but she instantly realized
that this could not be possible. The face that she
was looking down into on the surface of the pool
was as hideous a countenance as she had ever
gazed upon, scarred, distorted and crowned by a
head of matted hair that bristled at its top and
hung in tangled skeins over the ears. The face
was all that she could see.</p>

<p class='c007'>For an instant the eyes of the girl and the
woman above her seemed to meet on the face of
the waters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace whirled and sprang up, revolver in hand,
for there was menace in the eyes that she had
been looking into.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quick as the Overland girl was, Grace Harlowe
found herself gazing up at a barren shelf of rock,
unoccupied, silent as a tomb, with not a sign of
life to be seen, either there or anywhere about her.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was inexplicable. A feeling of something
akin to terror took possession of Grace Harlowe,
then all at once, panic seized her, and, uttering a
little cry, she fled on fleet foot back down the
stream, unheeding where it might lead her, hoping
and thinking only of getting away from that
which had given her such a fright.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXII' class='c008'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />THE MYSTERY OF AERIAL LAKE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Grace ran on until suddenly halted by a
shout from Hippy Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whither away, my pretty maid?”
cried Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! You gave me a start,” answered Grace
breathlessly. “I’ve had such a fright, Hippy.
I have seen the most awful face that I ever looked
upon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the words of the guide, ‘don’t wolly till
to-mollow.’ What did it look like? Tell me
about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Grace told him what had occurred and described
as best she could the face that she had seen
mirrored in the pool.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That sounds like the woman Woo saw watching
the camp,” he nodded. “I think we ought
to go back to camp and tell the folks what you
have discovered.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You mean it sounds like Woo’s description of
her,” answered Grace laughingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know what I mean. Come on!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders listened breathlessly to Grace
Harlowe’s story of her experience, but no one had
an explanation to offer. They asked her if she
had gone up to the rock to see if anyone were
hiding there, but Grace said she had not done so
because she was too frightened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve never lost my head before, but I surely
did this time,” she added, smiling in an embarrassed
sort of way. “I found a pool full of
mountain trout—no, not golden trout—and I
would suggest that one of you men go out and
see if you can’t catch a mess. Trout would be
relished by all, including even myself, scared as
I am.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Trout! Me for them,” cried Hippy. “You
come along, Tom, and perhaps, between us, we
may be able to find the beautiful creature that
gave Grace the first real scare of her life. I’m
glad you have found something that frightens
you,” chuckled Hippy. “Me for the fish now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom accompanied Lieutenant Wingate, leaving
Stacy with the girls, and with instructions to stay
in camp. The two men returned two hours later
with a mess of trout sufficient to last the party
several days. Stacy was asked to assist in cleaning
them, then the fish were broiled, and a delicious
trout meal was enjoyed. Not since they
started had they sat down to such dainty food.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overland Riders were on the trail early
next morning. This trail eventually led them up
the side of a mountain, over places where they
were obliged to hitch ropes to the ponies to assist
them over particularly troublesome spots, yet it
was all great fun.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the party went on, game become more
plentiful. Quail scuttled away at their approach,
with heads ducked low, and here and there a
flash of brown and white told of a frightened deer
fleeing to safety. No one ventured a shot. The
party had sufficient provisions for present needs,
and further, it was understood that, unless absolutely
necessary, there was to be no shooting.
Tom, however, killed a rattler that lay coiled on
a shelf of granite buzzing away like an alarm
clock, but that was the only exciting incident of
the morning’s ride. By noon they had worked
their way up to an apparently impassable ridge.
Tom went on ahead, soon returning with the
welcome information that there appeared to be a
break in the ridge about a mile to the south of
them, and that he thought they could get through
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders made camp late that afternoon,
and on the following morning, now thoroughly
rested, they followed rough and rugged
trails, surmounting difficulties almost as great as
the worst they had met above timber line. Their
reward came later in the morning when they
discovered that they had unerringly followed the
right course.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s the lake!” shouted Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before them, framed in a rim of black forest
and rock, lay a lake of the deepest emerald green
they had ever gazed upon. About the shore, and
extending down to the water, white pebbles
formed a mat for the picture.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is our Aerial Lake,” declared Grace. “It
is the same lake that we saw several days ago and
that we bombarded with rocks.” From somewhere
in that vicinity the shots that had disturbed
them undoubtedly had been fired. It was
quite a large body of water, just how large they
could not see, on account of a sharp bend in the
lake, and intervening mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aren’t we going down to make camp now?”
asked Elfreda Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, for I’m just dying to know what the
secret, the great dark secret, of Aerial Lake really
is,” bubbled Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From all accounts it’s a homely woman,”
laughed Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, there are others,” reminded Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was not a nice thing to say, Stacy,”
rebuked Grace, laughing in spite of her efforts to
be stern. “It was decidedly ungracious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So are the kind I mean,” retorted Stacy.
“Hark!”</p>

<p class='c007'>A rifle shot echoed through the canyons, but,
though ears were strained to catch the sound, no
second shot was heard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder at whom they are shooting this
time?” muttered Tom. “We are again reminded
that we are not the only persons in the High
Sierras, so let us be cautious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Watch your step, ladies and gentlemen,”
warned Stacy as the party started on.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders chose a camp site back among
the trees a few rods from the shore of the lake.
This site was not only well screened from observation,
but afforded an excellent view of the lake
as far as the bend. Camp was quickly made,
after which Stacy and Hippy shouldered their
rifles and started out to get acquainted with their
surroundings, as the party intended to remain at
the lake for several days. The two had gone but
a short distance from camp ere the Overlanders
heard Chunky utter a shout.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve found an ark,” he cried, pointing triumphantly
to a dugout canoe that lay on the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dugout had been hewn from a solid log
and bore indications of recent use. Stacy
searched for a paddle but could not find one.
While the Overlanders, who had hurried out to
him, were discussing Stacy’s find, Hippy was nosing
about on the beach, closely observing the
ground. He found boot tracks there, but they did
not appear to have been recently made, so he decided
that some days had elapsed since anyone
had been on that particular spot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy promptly forgot that he was out reconnoitering,
and, cutting down a small tree with his
hatchet, he proceeded to fashion a crude paddle
from it. He then announced that he was going
paddling. Tom said no, but Stacy said yes,
whereupon Hippy read his nephew a sharp lecture
on “respect to one’s elders.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To all this, Stacy made no reply, as he considered
that he would gain nothing were he to protest
too strenuously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s all,” finished Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, Uncle Hip. But if anything should
happen to me, you’ll be sorry that you were so
cruel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, take your old dugout and go on,” exclaimed
Hippy. “If you drown, don’t blame me.
If it were not that you are a good swimmer I
shouldn’t trust you in that cranky craft.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is very kind of your Uncle Hippy,”
reminded Grace. “I hope you appreciate it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy failed to answer. Still tinkering with
the paddle, he watched his companions out of the
corner of one eye, as they walked slowly back
towards their camp. Lieutenant Wingate, rifle
in the crook of one arm, continued on. An hour
and a half later, as Hippy was returning, he saw
his nephew paddling slowly down the lake.
Hippy waved his hat and “hoo-hooed,” to which
Stacy paid no attention whatever.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better keep in close. The wind is coming
up,” called Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy Brown was still silent, and Hippy, chuckling
to himself, went on to camp, where he told
his companions of things he had discovered on his
jaunt, none of which were of importance, except
that he had found further evidence of the presence
of human beings and horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>At luncheon time, Stacy was still absent, but
his absence excited no comment, because the boy
was very fond of the water and probably in his
enjoyment of it he had forgotten all about the
passage of time. But when it came four o’clock
in the afternoon and still no Stacy, someone suggested
that they go out and look for him. Hippy
was the one who went. He soon came running
back, waving his hat to attract the attention of
his companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Something has happened to Stacy!” he
shouted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it—what has become of him?”
called Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy’s dugout is floating bottomside up on
the lake, but he is nowhere in sight,” answered
Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders started at a run for the lake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There it is! I see it,” cried Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Hippy, can’t you do something?” begged
Nora. “What is that floating out there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a log,” answered Hippy. Despite the
fact that the whitecaps were rolling up the lake,
this log remained in one position all the time, but
no one of the Overland party observed that fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can swim out to the canoe. Who knows
but that Stacy may be under it?” offered Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no,” protested the Overlanders in one
voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Grace, the water is icy cold. To swim out
in that water would be the death of you. If
anyone does it, either Hippy or myself will,”
announced Tom. “Is that a hat I see floating
there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s Stacy’s hat,” cried Elfreda. “Oh, this
is too bad. Cannot something be done?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There he goes! He will be drowned. Somebody
stop him!” begged Emma as Lieutenant
Wingate plunged into the lake and began beating
his way towards the overturned canoe. Hippy
had not even paused to remove any part of his
clothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come back!” shouted Grace shrilly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come back!” urged Tom. “Even if he is
there you can’t help him now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t worry. I am all right,” came back
Lieutenant Wingate’s voice, sounding far away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy plenty cold watel,” piped Woo
Smith, but no one gave heed to his words, and it
is doubtful if any of the Overlanders even heard
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t believe Stacy is drowned at all,” declared
Emma. “You will laugh at me, but I
have a thought message that he isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is no time for nonsense, my dear,”
rebuked Elfreda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It isn’t nonsense, it’s transmigration,” protested
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time they observed that Hippy was
close to the dugout, and all eyes were fixed
anxiously on him. They saw him grasp the
turned-over boat, then dive under it. Hippy was
out of sight but a few moments when his head
was seen bobbing up on the opposite side of the
dugout.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders shouted to him, but the wind
was against them and Hippy did not even know
that they were calling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Someone run to camp and fetch a bath towel,”
urged Grace. “Never mind, I’ll go,” she added,
starting away at a run for the camp. Grace was
back ere Lieutenant Wingate reached the shore.
Tom was there to meet him, and assisted Hippy,
dripping, and blue of face and lips, to his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, Tom. Take the towel and give Hippy
a brisk rub-down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How—where?” gasped Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anywhere. Go out in the bushes, do it anywhere,
but for goodness sake don’t delay. What
did you find?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing—not a single thing to indicate
anything,” answered Lieutenant Wingate dully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please hurry! Don’t you see that Hippy has
a chill, Tom?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Gray hustled his companion out of sight,
then stripped him and gave him a brisk rubdown,
so brisk in fact that Hippy finally begged
him to stop.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shan’t have any skin left if you go one rub
further,” he complained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here is Hippy’s other suit,” called Nora.
“How is he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Skinned alive,” answered Hippy with a groan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom ran out and snatched up the suit, which
he immediately assisted Hippy to put on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you still chilly?” questioned Captain
Gray after his companion had gotten fully into
dry clothes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should say not, after what you have done
to me. I don’t care anything about my own condition.
What I am half crazy about is Stacy.
I don’t, for the life of me, understand how a fellow
who can swim as well as he, <i>could</i> drown. Tom,
help me out. What do you think I had better
do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do? I think you have done enough—all
that can be done. My advice is that we get back
to camp. The girls have a good fire going, and
my suggestion is that you sit by the fire and dry
out your shoes while we decide what we should
do next.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t suppose there <i>is</i> need for hurry. If
he is drowned he’s drowned, and that’s all there
is about it, and if he isn’t, he isn’t. Yes, we will
go back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Tom and Hippy emerged from Nature’s
dressing room, Tom carrying his chum’s wet
clothing, they found the Overland girls awaiting
them a short distance away. Nora embraced
Hippy and wept on his shoulder, and, as a matter
of fact, the other three girls of the party had
difficulty in keeping their own tears back.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, this is terrible!” moaned Nora.</p>

<p class='c007'>Emma pulled herself together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have a mental message that Stacy is all
right, and that he will be back to-night,” comforted
Miss Dean.</p>

<p class='c007'>“False hopes, I am afraid,” answered Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woo, how deep is that lake?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Woo consulted the skies.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No savvy. Mebby fish can tell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No more was said. It was a sober Overland
party that slowly retraced its steps to the camp,
but, as they stepped in among the trees and came
in sight of the little camp, the Overlanders halted
abruptly and gazed astounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>On a blanket that he had spread out sat Stacy
Brown, his clothing wrinkled and dirty. Before
him stood two cans of beans, open, and a plate
of trout, while both cheeks protruded unnaturally
as Stacy gazed soulfully at his companions.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIII' class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />THE LAIR OF THE BAD MEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Hulloa, folks!” greeted Stacy thickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy!” cried Nora, running to
him and throwing impulsive arms
about the neck of her nephew.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wingate drew Nora away and stood
gazing down sternly at the munching Chunky.
No one said a word, except Woo Smith, who
hummed his “Hi-lee, hi-lo!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where have you been?” finally demanded
Hippy sternly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I’ve been up there,” pointing to the side
of the mountain, at the same time getting to his
feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sit down! Now out with it. The whole
story, sir!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was mad with you. I—I—I thought it
would be fun to fool you all. There wasn’t anybody
in sight, so I tipped over and—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Accidentally?” interrupted Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. On purpose. Then I shoved the canoe
out and threw my hat into the water, climbed up
the side of the mountain and watched you all
hunting for me,” chuckled Stacy. “You all had
been so hard on me that I didn’t care if I never
came back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t understand how you could stand it
to stay away at meal time,” wondered Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, that was all right. I had some biscuit,
then I found some dried venison in a cache in a
cave up there. Somebody had been there. It
was fine food, I tell you, but all the time I kept
my eyes on the camp. I didn’t think you would
go away and leave me, but I wasn’t taking
chances. It was lots of fun watching you folks
searching for Stacy Brown’s body, and I laughed
when I saw Uncle Hip swimming out to look
under the canoe. Say, you can swim some, can’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy bristled. Stacy’s last words were the
crowning ones. Lieutenant Wingate nodded to
Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, Stacy. We wish you to go down by
the lake with us. Fetch your paddle,” directed
Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wha—at are you going to do?” stammered
the boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We three are going paddling, my beloved
nephew,” answered Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t be too hard on him,” whispered Grace
as the three were about to depart, Stacy going
reluctantly, but not daring to offer further
objections.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give me that paddle,” ordered Hippy when
they had reached a point well out of sight of the
camp. “Stacy Brown, you have done about the
most unforgivable thing that a boy could do.
You led us to believe that you had been drowned;
you have caused us much mental anguish, and it
is no more than right that we ‘transmigrate’ a
little of it to you. Lie down on your stomach!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want to. Wha—at are you going
to do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going to paddle you, young man. Tom,
how many do you think would be about right?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should say that a paddle, one paddle, for
each member of the Overland party would be
about right,” suggested Tom Gray. “There are
six of us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment more and Hippy Wingate was delivering
the punishment, not too hard, but just
enough so as to make his plump nephew writhe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Six! There!” announced Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You forgot to give him one for Woo Smith,”
suggested Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re right.” Hippy remedied the oversight
at once. “Get up! You made me swim in the
cold lake, so I think I will give you a dose of the
same medicine. I’m going to throw you in the
lake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, wow!” howled Chunky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, no,” protested Tom Gray. “Don’t do
that, Hippy. He might catch cold and be sick
on our hands,” grinned Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll be even with you for this, Uncle Hip,”
threatened Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He hasn’t had enough yet, Tom. Help me
throw him in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I have. I’ve had enough. I’ll never
play such a trick on you again. It was a low-down
trick to play. Next time I’ll do it in some
other way, but if you let me alone I’ll let you
alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t make threats,” warned Lieutenant
Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can tell you something you want to know,
too. I know something that you don’t know,”
answered Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“First you had better come back to camp and
apologize to the girls,” suggested Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy went along, rather timidly at first; then,
as the thought of what he had discovered occurred
to him, he swelled out his chest and began to
boast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose you tell us what it is that you have
discovered,” suggested Grace after Tom had repeated
to the girls what Stacy said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. I’ll tell you. When I was trying to
get where you folks wouldn’t see me, I dodged
behind some bushes and discovered that I was
right in front of an opening in the rocks. At
first I thought it was a bear den. Then I
stumbled against a big bear trap that closed with
a crash, but it didn’t frighten me at all. You
see I am not a bear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Emma said there might be a difference of
opinion on that subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I lighted a match and found a lantern, just
like the train conductors use. I looked about
and found myself in a cave. I found a lot of
stuff there, including some boxes of crackers and
venison, that was cached to keep it away from
the bears if they got past the trap.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders were keenly interested. Elfreda
asked what else he had found in the cave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mostly things to eat and to eat with. I didn’t
bother about much of anything else. I reckon
maybe it was the bad men’s cave that I discovered.
When it comes to making discoveries I don’t suppose
there is a human being who can equal
myself. The only thing that I can’t lay claim to
having discovered is Emma Dean.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is because your ideals and your instincts
lack elevation,” retorted Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom and Hippy glanced at each other and
nodded. Both were of the same mind with reference
to Stacy’s discovery. Perhaps there lay the
real secret of the Aerial Lake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us go over and investigate,” suggested
Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m with you,” agreed Hippy. “Stacy, you
will please lead the way to this bandit retreat,
or whatever it may be, but if you fool us again,
it’s the lake for yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>All hands started for the cave, with Stacy
Brown in the lead, full of importance. It was
quite a rough climb to the scene of Stacy’s discovery,
and the boy took the worst course he could
find to reach it, which the others of the party
suspected ere they had gone far on their way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look out for bear traps!” warned Chunky.
“You know I haven’t looked about much on the
inside. There! Look at that, will you?” he
demanded, parting the bushes and revealing a
small dark opening in the rocks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You aren’t going into that hole, are you?”
cried Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I went in, didn’t I?” returned Stacy. “I
didn’t have a crowd of women with me, though.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy entered first, using his pocket lamp to
light the way, followed by Stacy and Tom, then
the others filed in, leaving Woo Smith on the outside
to see that they were not surprised by the
former occupants of the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once inside, the Overlanders found that the
roof of the cave was high enough to permit them
to stand erect, but beyond them the darkness was
so deep that they could not see the end of the
hole in the mountain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Br-r-r! I’m afraid,” cried Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s because you aren’t a man,” answered
Stacy. “Hulloa! There’s some stuff that I
didn’t see.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pullman car blankets!” exclaimed Tom Gray.
“This looks as if we had made a real discovery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You mean I have,” corrected Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. It is plunder. No mistake about that,”
agreed Lieutenant Wingate. “Stacy, did you
look around farther back in the cave?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. I didn’t have time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think you were afraid of the dark,” teased
Elfreda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy is afraid of nothing at all, you know,
Elfreda,” reminded Grace laughingly, whereupon
Stacy’s chest swelled perceptibly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not,” he made reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>A systematic search of all parts of the cave
failed to reveal anything of great value, but they
decided that it might be wise to remove some of
the blankets as proof of what they had found.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know something else, too,” spoke up Stacy
Brown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well?” demanded Hippy, eyeing Stacy
suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The log is chained down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What log?” questioned Grace quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That log out in the lake,” Stacy informed
them. “It’s funny that you folks haven’t noticed
that it has been in the same position ever
since we got here. There’s something queer about
that log, too. I observed it the first time I walked
along the shore, but it didn’t make much of an
impression on me at the moment, and—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I doubt if it would have done so if it had
fallen on you,” interposed Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you. One would hardly notice the log
at all unless the lake were quite rough, which
would enable you to see the full length of the log
when it was in a trough. I examined the log
when I was out in the canoe, and there’s something
else about it that is queer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders with one accord started for
the shore to look at the log.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s chained down,” shouted Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe the boy is right,” exclaimed Elfreda
Briggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where’s that dugout?” called Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon it has gone around the bend,” answered
Emma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. The wind is in the wrong direction,”
answered Tom. “I see it! There it is, at the
upper end. It has drifted sideways to the beach.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going to have a look at that log,” cried
Hippy, starting at a run for the dugout. Tom
and his companions followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy, get the paddle,” directed Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fat boy obeyed without protest, which was
rather unusual for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy plenty piecee fun,” chattered Woo
as they ran.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I am a prophet, you will be savvying something
besides fun before we have done with this
affair,” observed Elfreda Briggs soberly. “This
is only the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy arrived with the paddle about the time
that Hippy and Tom reached the dugout. The
two men turned the boat over and shoved it out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You girls remain on shore,” ordered Hippy.
“The boat will not hold more and give us room
to work. Stacy, you sit still. Don’t you dare
rock the boat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lake was still rough and Hippy found it
hard work to handle the dugout, but after throwing
off his coat and shifting his passengers to
better balance the dugout, he made better headway,
finally reaching the bobbing log.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stacy is right. The log is anchored,” exclaimed
Tom. “What can that mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are going to find out right smart, Captain,”
answered Hippy. “Do you see? The
thing is anchored with a chain about its middle,
and from rings, bolted to the ends, ropes lead
down into the lake. That must mean that something
is at the other end of the ropes. Tom, you
ballast the other end of the dugout while Stacy
and I pull on the rope at this end. We will try
not to upset you. For myself, I have had one
ducking to-day and that is quite sufficient. Stacy
has one coming to him. All right, Chunky, heave
away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They hauled on the rope with all the strength
they dared exert, for to pull with too strong a
hand meant a ducking in the cold waters of the
lake.</p>

<p class='c007'>Something came slowly to the surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, fudge! It’s an anchor—it is a piece of
iron,” grumbled Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but it isn’t an anchor,” answered Hippy
excitedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boys, you have pulled up an iron box. Can
you get it aboard?” cried Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the box, in yellow letters, was the name of
a well-known express company. The box was
securely locked, and apparently the lock had not
been tampered with.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve made a find!” cried Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Loot of some sort,” agreed Tom. “That is
a money chest, probably of the same sort that the
Red Limited was carrying when the bandits
attacked our train between Summit and Gardner.
There is undoubtedly another one like it at my
end of the log, but the question is what are we
going to do with our find.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are we going to do with it? Why,
we’re going to open it, of course,” declared Stacy.
“If there is loot in it, findin’s is keepin’s so far
as Stacy Brown is concerned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom was of the opinion that they had no right
to open the chest, but suggested that they take
it and whatever else they might find, to a safe
place and bury it, and then get word to the
authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe you have the right thought,” nodded
Hippy, after a moment’s reflection. “There can
be no doubt that this is stolen property, not the
least doubt in the world. Therefore we are not
taking another man’s property—we are trying
to save stolen property. Come, Stacy, let’s give
it another haul, then try to lift it aboard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I don’t get any of the plunder, I don’t
haul,” objected Chunky stubbornly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pull! If you don’t I’ll throw you overboard,”
threatened Hippy savagely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll drop it if you do. I’ll—”</p>

<p class='c007'>A bullet snipped the water not a dozen yards
from the dugout, followed by the report of a rifle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re under fire! Look out!” shouted the
voice of Grace Harlowe, shrill and piercing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let ’em shoot!” retorted Hippy. “Tom, are
you game to go through with it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Bang, bang, bang!</i>” Three bullets hit the
water close at hand, sending up little spurts of
white spray. Another bullet went through the
top of Stacy Brown’s hat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wow!” howled Chunky. “You can get
shot if you want to, but I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Buck up!” urged Lieutenant Wingate.
“We’ll have the thing aboard in a moment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Another bullet sang past them, clipping a sliver
from the side of the dugout. The sliver hit Stacy
on his bare arm and drew blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m hit! Good-night!” yelled Stacy, suddenly
letting go of the rope and diving head first
into the lake.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Stacy let go of the rope and took his dive,
the iron chest splashed and went to the bottom,
causing the canoe to turn turtle. Lieutenant
Wingate and Captain Gray were hurled into the
icy waters of the Aerial Lake head first, with
bullets spattering in the water all about them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='chXXIV' class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />MAKING A LAST STAND</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“You poor fish!” roared Hippy as he
came up sputtering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy was making for the shore at
full speed, creating considerable disturbance in
the water as he progressed. Tom Gray and
Hippy, concluding that safety first was the motto
for them, were hitting up a rapid gait. The
bullets, however, did not cease falling about
them. All at once reports of other rifles, apparently
fired close at hand, reached the ears of the
swimmers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The girls are shooting!” cried Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overland girls had run to camp for their
rifles, and with them were trying to search out
the hidden mountain marksmen, trusting to drive
the mountaineers off, or at least to check their
fire until their three companions could reach
shore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy and Tom were swimming for the shore
in the direction of the mountain cave. Observing
this, the Overland girls ran forward to meet them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hurry! Oh, hurry!” shouted Nora in great
distress.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They can’t reach us with their bullets now,”
answered Hippy. “We are protected by the
overhang of the mountain on their side.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hippy is right. They have stopped shooting,”
announced Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this juncture Stacy Brown floundered ashore
and ran dripping towards the cave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, here! Where are you going?” called
Elfreda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Into my bomb-proof shelter; that’s where I’m
going,” flung back Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You had better hide,” reminded Elfreda.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where’s that boy?” cried Hippy as he, too,
floundered ashore.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind Stacy now. We have other and
more important matters on hand,” answered
Grace. “Hurry, Tom. I have sent Woo up
among the rocks to act as lookout while we consider
what to do next.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is a fine mess. Here I am drenched to
the skin, shivering like a man with the ague, and
a band of scoundrels trying to shoot me up.
Hospitable country, I must say,” complained Tom
Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It might be worse. You and Hippy had
better go into the cave and change your clothes,”
suggested Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Change to what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s so. It might be imprudent for any
of us to go to camp for fresh clothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, girls, let’s gather wood and build a
fire,” urged Miss Briggs. “We can build a small
fire in the cave and let our men dry out in there
and we will stand guard on the outside.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good! That is real headwork,” agreed Tom.
“Give me a handful of sticks and I’ll start a fire
if you will provide the matches. Mine are
soaked.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy had already started in search of Stacy
Brown, but Stacy was not in sight. He had fled
to the farther end of the cave, whence he was
gazing apprehensively towards the opening.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may come out,” offered Hippy. “I’m
too wet to have my interview with you now.
When I get dried out I’ll have a friendly conversation
with you. Come out!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy sidled out, watching Uncle Hip narrowly.
Tom came in at this juncture, with an armful of
twigs that the girls had gathered, and started a
small fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want to be smoked out,” complained
Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is worse than that coming to you,
young man,” reminded Tom. “At present, however,
we have other things to attend to. Strip
and dry out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want to dry out. I want to be
soaked,” retorted Stacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t worry. You’re going to be,” warned
Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it hadn’t been for me you folks never would
have discovered anything,” Stacy declared, turning
a reproachful gaze on his two companions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if it hadn’t been for you, I should not
have been dumped into a lake of ice water twice
in one day,” returned Hippy. “Tom, what is
your idea of this shooting?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have interfered with someone’s business,
that’s plain,” replied Tom. “When we hauled
up that box of plunder, or whatever it may be,
they let go at us with their rifles. Nor is that
the worst of it—we are in for more trouble, and
I should not be at all surprised to see it break at
any moment, I—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tom!” cried Grace Harlowe with a rising
inflection in her voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woo is running towards the cave, waving his
arms. I think he has discovered something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy nodded at Tom and began drawing on
his wet clothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“May the girls go inside now?” called Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! Keep out! We will be ready in a
moment,” answered Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>A shot, followed by a howl from Woo Smith,
caused the two men to redouble their efforts.
Hippy finished dressing first and ran out, rifle in
hand, just as the guide came running up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me savvy tlouble. Plenty men come ’long.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How many?” interjected Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sees.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Six, eh? We ought to be able to handle
them,” answered Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There probably are more than six. What
shall we do?” questioned Grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All hands get inside the cave. From there
we can watch the lake, and at the same time be
fairly well protected,” directed Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Acting upon a hail from Tom that he was ready,
the Overlanders hastened into the cave, where
Woo was questioned in detail as to what he had
observed. Having obtained all the information
that the guide had to give, Hippy and Tom
crept out, and lay secreted in the bushes in front
of the cave to guard against surprises.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had been there but a short time when
Lieutenant Wingate discovered a man on the
rocks about a hundred yards to the right of them.
At almost the same instant Tom Gray nudged his
companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two men are over in our camp,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t shoot. Time enough for that. They
don’t know where we are. They—” Hippy
paused abruptly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They don’t, eh?” jeered Tom Gray as a bullet
flattened itself on the rocks just above the opening
into the cave. “Keep down in there!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think they are merely trying to smoke us
out,” answered Hippy calmly.</p>

<p class='c007'>A scattering volley of bullets was fired at the
cave opening as he spoke, but there was no response
from the besieged Overland Riders. Elfreda
called softly to know if the two men needed
assistance, but both said all the assistance they
needed just then was to be let alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There go the ponies!” exclaimed Tom Gray.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Hippy looked he saw three men leading
the Overland saddle ponies into a defile in the
mountains. Hippy threw up his rifle, but lowered
it instantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It won’t do any good to shoot. Then again
I might hit a pony. What I want to do is to get
a man. Sh-h-h-h!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man that Hippy had seen, but who had
disappeared immediately afterward, he now discovered
lying on a slab of rock up high enough
to give him a fairly good view of the entrance to
the cave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see him. Don’t move. He is looking this
way,” whispered Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a few moments of cautious observation,
the man on the rock crawled back and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day was rapidly drawing to a close and
the two Overland men began to feel considerable
concern. There was little hope in their minds
that they were going to get out of their present
situation that night. Tom and Hippy discussed
the situation, and considered the idea of creeping
away in the night, but finally concluded that their
greatest safety lay in keeping out of sight and
awaiting developments.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is their move first,” declared Tom. “And
when they do start something we shall be on the
job, though I am a little concerned about our
ammunition. We have none to waste. It seems
to me that there ought to be some in that cave, if
the scoundrels are half as prudent as we think
they are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy called softly to Nora, asking her to have
a thorough search of the cave made to see if
ammunition might not be found. Half an hour
later Nora reported that they could find none.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then we shall have to get along with what
we have,” decided Tom Gray. “With what we
have we ought to be able to give a pretty fair
account of ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Night fell, with the lake and the mountainsides
bathed in a flood of moonlight, for the moon
was full and well up. The fire in the cave had
long since been put out so that the besiegers
might not smell the smoke, and, shortly after
dark, the girls passed out a luncheon, taken from
the stores of food that Stacy Brown had discovered
on his first visit to the cave. Tom and
Hippy were munching this eagerly, when Tom
uttered a suppressed exclamation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look yonder!” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s the dugout!” breathed Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dugout, with three men in it, was being
rapidly paddled out into the lake, which was now
quiet, a gleaming sheet of silver in the bright
moonlight. The paddlers went straight to the
log and began hauling up on the rope at one end.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are after the chests. What would you
advise, Tom?” asked Hippy eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are going to shoot, that’s what,” answered
Tom Gray, leveling his rifle. “I don’t want to
hit anyone, but I do want to give them a scare.”
Taking careful aim at the canoe, he fired—and
missed. Tom shot again, and this time his bullet
reached its mark—the dugout.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy Wingate tried a shot and scored a hit
the first time. The men in the dugout showed
indications of panic.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let ’em have it hard,” urged Tom, whereupon
both men began shooting, but the shooting was
not confined to their own rifles. From somewhere
on the mountain-side other rifles spoke, and
bullets spattered against the rocks that stood out
white in the moonlight, hard by the cave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’ve located us!” cried Tom Gray.
“Stacy, come out here, but creep out,” he ordered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fat boy came wriggling out, rifle in hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“See if you can find the fellows who are shooting
at us; then stir them up,” directed Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few moments later, Chunky’s rifle spoke. In
the meantime Tom and Hippy had been shooting
at the boat, taking their time, aiming with
deliberation, until finally the fire became too hot
for the men in the dugout, and they paddled
rapidly shoreward to the other side of the lake.
Soon after their arrival there they began to shoot
at the cave-mouth. Hippy and Tom then turned
their rifles in that direction, but with what result
they were unable to determine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stacy shot slowly and steadily, without apparent
nervousness, and the two men began to feel
respect for the irrepressible Chunky. After a
time the fire on both sides died down and silence
settled over the scene. Finally, Grace suggested
that she and Elfreda relieve the men of their
watch, which, after reflection, was agreed to.
After a vigil of some hours Grace called for Tom
and pointed towards the lake, that was shining
in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is not something moving out there?” she
questioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. It is those scoundrels after the chests
again. Call Hippy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>After watching the shadowy shape of the dugout
for some moments the two Overland men
again opened fire, and once more the dugout was
hurriedly paddled ashore.</p>

<p class='c007'>No further disturbance occurred that night.
The girls went to sleep, but Lieutenant Wingate
and Captain Gray remained on duty from that
time on. All of the following day was spent in
the cave, not a shot being fired on either side.
The Overlanders were of the opinion that their
adversaries were keeping out of sight for the purpose
of luring the party out into the open, so
they remained where they were.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another night came on, and at about ten o’clock
the Overland Riders were treated to a deluge of
rifle bullets, which was not returned, as the
ammunition supply was now too low.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Grace, have you taken an inventory of the
food?” asked Tom, after the firing had died down.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. We have enough for present needs, but
have you considered that we may be held here
until either we starve or are shot? I, for one,
am in favor of making our escape. Take my word
for it, our besiegers will play some trick that will
prove our undoing,” declared Grace with strong
conviction in her tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will stick it out another day,” answered
Lieutenant Wingate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And walk all the way back to Gardner,”
finished Elfreda Briggs. “I am of the opinion
that—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hark!” warned Nora, holding up a hand for
silence. A faint tapping sound was heard by all.
It seemed to be somewhere over their heads, but
no one was able to interpret the sound, and after
a time it ceased.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Something is doing. Get your rifles ready,”
ordered Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The words had no sooner left his lips than a
heavy detonating explosion sent a shower of rock
and dirt down over their heads. None of the
pieces was large enough to injure the Overlanders,
but the dust set them coughing and choking so
that instinctively all crowded towards the cave
entrance for air, and further, because of fear that
the rocks above might cave in on them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was dynamite!” exclaimed Tom Gray.
“Either they are trying to bury us here or to
drive us out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I am going out,” declared Lieutenant
Wingate. “Tom, you stay here, but for goodness
sake make the folks keep down. The first
head I see I am going to shoot at. Give me some
cartridges, each of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Five minutes later Lieutenant Wingate was
crawling out on his stomach as silently as an
Indian. Once more he heard that familiar tapping
on the rocks above the cave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fiends!” he muttered. “I’ve got to get
up to their level or go above them.” He decided
to proceed to the left of the cave, then ascend
and approach the rocks above it. This he succeeded
in doing. About the time he came within
sight of the rocks over the cave the ground was
shaken by another explosion. In the bright
moonlight, he saw three men running towards the
scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hippy threw up his rifle and fired. One of the
three men plunged forward and rolled over the
edge of the rocks, landing, as Lieutenant Wingate
thought, near the entrance to the cave. The
other two men instantly disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One!” growled the Overland Rider, hurriedly
removing himself from that particular locality.
Reaching a point where he could look across the
cave entrance, Hippy made a startling discovery.
The second charge of dynamite had been fired
close to the edge of the rocks overhanging the
cave entrance, so that the falling rocks had
blocked it entirely. Lieutenant Wingate now
crawled to the entrance, not knowing what instant
he might be the target for a bullet, and, placing
his lips close to a crevice, called softly.</p>

<p class='c007'>His hail was answered from within. To his
great relief, he learned that none of his companions
had been injured, but that they dared
not try to remove the wreckage from the inside
fearing they might bring down a mass of rocks.
Hippy advised them to remain quiet until later
when he would try to work his way in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just now, I must keep a sharp lookout,” he
added. Not another shot did he get at their adversaries,
however, but just after daylight a rattling
fire sprang up. Listening attentively, Hippy
concluded that two parties were engaged in the
shooting—at it “hammer and tongs,” as he
expressed it. A few minutes later he saw two
men running for the lake—saw them leap into
the dugout and paddle excitedly towards the
anchored log. He waited until they began to haul
in on the rope at one end of the log, and then
opened fire. One bullet bowled a man over. The
other man grabbed the paddle and struck out for
the shore with all speed. He had nearly reached
it when a burst of fire from among the trees near
where the Overland camp was located knocked
the man over. He fell over backwards in the
dugout, which slowly drifted ashore.</p>

<p class='c007'>A group of horsemen at this juncture rode out
into the open, and an instant later a bullet
whistled past Hippy’s head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gee whiz!” exclaimed Lieutenant Wingate.
“I reckon the whole community has it in for me.
I’ve got to have a look at those people.” With
that Hippy worked his way cautiously through
the bushes until he got an unobstructed view of
the newcomers. The Overland Rider gazed, and
as he did so his under jaw sagged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye-o-o-o-w!” yelled Hippy, leaping to his
feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>A rifle bullet answered him, but he was down
ere it reached him. Once more he sprang up and
fired three quick shots straight up into the air,
then went down again. This time there was an
interval, then the welcome answer—three signal
shots—was fired. Hippy got up and waved his
hat. He had recognized one member of that
party. That member was Sheriff Ford.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Overland!” shouted Lieutenant Wingate
upon getting to his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sheriff Ford did not recognize him at once, but
the party of horsemen rode towards him with
rifles at ready, Hippy standing out in the open
with hands held up. Sheriff Ford then uttered
a shout as he recognized the Overland Rider.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a happy meeting—for Hippy Wingate.
It took but a moment for explanations. A posse,
with two sheriffs, including Ford, and five husky
citizens of Gardner, had come out in search of the
bandits who had tried to rob the Red Limited,
and who were supposed to have held up and
robbed another treasure train a week earlier.</p>

<p class='c007'>On their way to release the Overland party,
Hippy confided to Sheriff Ford the discovery of
the iron chests secured to the log in the lake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose there is a reward for the recovery
of the plunder, but if there is, you take it. We
don’t want it,” said Hippy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sheriff Ford protested, but Hippy said the
Overland Riders could not consider accepting a
reward under any circumstances. Ford said that
in such event, the reward would be shared by the
members of the posse, and that, in fact, the reward
offered by the express company was the
principal motive for the posse coming out to try
to accomplish what the Pinkertons had thus far
failed to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overlanders were, after considerable hard
work, released from their imprisonment in the
cave, and it was then that Ford told them of the
fight with the bandits, who, he said, were all
members of the Jones Boys’ gang. Of ten bandits,
the posse had killed or wounded four. They
found two who had been wounded before the arrival
of the posse, one of whom, Hippy believed,
was the fellow he had shot on the shelf of rock,
and took four prisoners, including Mother Jones,
the mother of the leaders of the gang. Four
bandits had succeeded in escaping.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother Jones!” exclaimed the Overlanders.</p>

<p class='c007'>As it later developed, it was Mother Jones
whose face had so frightened Woo, and which
Grace Harlowe had seen reflected in the pool.
Mother Jones had done the shooting at the
Overlanders, following the Overland party’s discovery
of the chests in the lake. It was Mother Jones
who had fired at them when they were bombarding
the lake with boulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>No time was lost in getting the chests from the
bottom of the lake, and none was more interested
in the contents than were the original discoverers,
the Overland Riders. The chests were found to
contain something more than half a million
dollars in gold and banknotes, but two other
chests stolen from the same shipment never were
found, though the lake was dragged from end to
end. It was believed that the contents of the
missing chests had been divided among the bandits
and secreted somewhere in the mountains, but
not a man of the Jones gang would admit this to
be the fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overland ponies were found secreted in a
mountain defile, and that night there was a jollification
in camp, a real feast of venison and trout,
songs and story-telling, even Woo Smith indulging
in his familiar song, to which no one now
objected. Stacy Brown overlooked no opportunity
to call attention to the fact that he was
the one who had discovered the treasure chests,
discovered the log to which they were anchored,
and said he supposed that the railroad or the
express company owed him a hundred thousand
dollars.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How much do you want? Come now,” urged
Sheriff Ford.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Want?” exclaimed Stacy. “I don’t want
anything from you, but I want these unfortunate
Overland Riders to appreciate what I have done
for them, and I want them to apologize to me for
the abuse they heaped on me while I was seeking
to transmigrate trouble from their doors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sheriff Ford laughed heartily at Stacy’s
remarks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For he’s a jolly good fellow,” began Nora
Wingate, in which the Overland Riders joined
whole-heartedly, even Emma Dean, for the moment,
forgetting her feud with Stacy Brown to
the extent of keeping time with her lips, Woo
Smith independently chattering his “Hi-lee, hi-lo!”
shouts of laughter winding up the tribute
to the fat boy’s hold on their affections.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Overland Riders decided to accompany the
sheriffs and their party to Gardner. Being well
satisfied with their vacation they were now ready
to go home. The prisoners and the treasure were
taken along to Gardner, which was reached several
days later. Then the Riders entrained for home
after the most interesting journey they had ever
taken. On their way east they elected the irrepressible
Chunky to full membership in the Overland
Riders, and he promised to accompany them
on their next season’s ride.</p>

<p class='c007'>The story of that ride will be found in a following
volume entitled, “<span class='sc'>Grace Harlowe’s Overland
Riders in the Yellowstone National
Park</span>.” The mysterious loss of the Riders’
ponies, the raid of the grizzlies, the puzzling robbery
at the Springs Hotel, a night of terror on
Electric Mountain, the hold-up of the Cumberland
coach, and the solving of the Yellowstone
mystery, are among the many experiences that
befell Grace Harlowe’s Riders on their never-to-be-forgotten
journey through the great National
Park.</p>
